SSP localizes to stigmatic papillae and has been shown to have functions in pollen-stigma interactions, protection of stigmas from pathogen attack, and production of a 27 amino acid signal peptide. SSP has low peroxidase activity compared to other peroxidases and has no effect on S-genotype. SSP prefers diphenolic substrates and enhances ROS/H2O2. SSP is expressed during the infection process and is involved in host-pathogen interactions. SSP replaces MAP and is regulated by ABI3, FUS3, LEC1, RISBZ1, RPBF, TANAC77, and other factors. SSP protein accumulates in zygote and endosperm and causes YDA activity, which enhances colonization. SSP effectors promote HR and are involved in SSP transport. MTSSPDB contains a compendium of SSP candidates and provides an online plant SSP prediction tool. GOLGI-dependent pathways dominate the role in SSP transport and contribute to SSP delivery. Factors, nutrient availability, YDA, and GA affect SSP accumulation, while RGL3 and FUSCA3 maintain SSP. TANAC77 enhances SSP genes, and SSP transcripts are produced in mature pollen. Ectopic expression of SSP protein activates YDA-dependent signaling, and KD-RISBZ1/KD-RPBF represses SSP gene expression. Motifs are found in SSP gene promoters, and SSP gene promoters enriched in rare motifs. Brassicaceae/Fabaceae SSP gene promoters contain two RY-like and one ACGT-like motif, while Fabaceae SSP gene promoters enriched in a novel, seed-specific E2FB-like motif. Poaceae SSP gene promoters contain GCN4-like, two Prolamin-box-like, and SKN-1-like motifs, and TATA-box variant of present in SSP gene promoters from three plant families. DCP5 is a transcriptional repressor of SSP mRNAs, and genome reveals 1,970 homologs of established SSP gene families. RNA sequencing data sets assesses expression patterns of known and putative SSP genes. Cladosporium fulvum produces SSP effectors, and RLPS recognizes SSP effectors. ASPG1 represses SSP degradation, and PK composes SSP kinome. RNA-seq reveals significant similarities between SBI and SSP, and environment affects SSP biosynthesis. Organelles play a role in SSP biosynthesis, and molecular mechanisms elude SSP trafficking. Endomembrane system accomplishes SSP transport, and molecular machineries maintains SSP trafficking. Plant-unique regulators contributes to SSP trafficking, and SSP scenarios downscales wheat suitability.

Additionally, GLR3.1 has been shown to distort root meristematic activity (16377757), enhance programmed cell death (16377757), and maintain cell division and individual cell survival (16377757). The localization of GLR3.1 to guard cells (19143998) has also been observed, and over-expression of this gene has been shown to impair external Ca(2+)-induced stomatal closure (19143998). Furthermore, the over-expression of GLR3.1 has been mimicked by the use of cyclohexamide, a compound that selectively inhibits the activity of the gene (19143998).

AT2G17420,"The gene AT2G17420 is involved in various cellular processes, including stress tolerance, auxin transport, and biosynthesis. The gene encodes a protein called NTRA, which is localized in the nucleus and plays a crucial role in regulating the expression of genes involved in these processes. NTRA has been shown to repress the expression of genes involved in developmental processes, such as TRXS of group I and II, and to regulate the levels of auxin and other plant hormones.  Mutations in the AT2G17420 gene have been found to affect the phenotype of plants. For example, a mutant with a triple NTRA NTRB CAD2 mutation displays a phenotype similar to that of auxin transport/biosynthesis mutants, including loss of apical dominance, vascular defects, and reduced secondary root production. The mutant also exhibits other defects in processes regulated by auxin, such as lower auxin (IAA) levels and decreased capacity for pat.  In addition, the NTRA NTRB CAD2 mutant has been found to have a phenotype similar to that of wild-type plants, but with a few exceptions. For example, the mutant displays a phenotype of a plant that is more tolerant to UV-C light than wild-type plants. The mutant also has a higher resistance to UV-light than wild-type plants, as evidenced by the TT4 mutant.  Furthermore, the NTRA NTRB/ROOTMERISTEMLESS1 mutant has been found to inhibit shoot/root growth, suggesting that the NTRA protein plays a crucial role in regulating shoot/root growth.  Overall, the gene AT2G17420 is a key regulator of various cellular processes, including stress tolerance, auxin transport, and biosynthesis. Mutations in this gene can affect the phenotype of plants, and the NTRA protein plays a crucial role in regulating the expression of genes involved in these processes."

Studies have shown that HB24 maintains the expression of the IBR1 gene, which is necessary for the conversion of IBA to IAA (PubMed ID: 34480752). Additionally, HB24 promotes the conversion of IBA to IAA, which is essential for the biosynthesis of IAA (PubMed ID: 34480752). The expression of IAA is positively impacted by HB24, and IBA does not rescue HB24 mutants, indicating that HB24 is essential for the proper functioning of the IAA biosynthetic pathway (PubMed ID: 34480752). Overall, the gene AT2G18350, also known as HB24, plays a critical role in regulating the expression of the IAA gene and is essential for the proper functioning of the IAA biosynthetic pathway."
