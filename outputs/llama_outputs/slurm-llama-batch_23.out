> Assistant:  The gene AT5G15380, also known as DRM1, plays a crucial role in regulating the expression of the gene SUP, which is involved in the development of plants. Studies have shown that DRM1 regulates the de novo methylation of CpG sites in the promoter region of the SUP gene, leading to its silencing (12121623). Additionally, DRM1 has been shown to inhibit the reactivation of previously established SUP alleles that have been silenced through epigenetic mechanisms (12121623).

DRM1 has also been shown to affect the expression of other genes involved in flowering, such as FLC, EMF, and TFL1 (15740643). DRM1 promotes the expression of these genes by binding to specific DNA sequences upstream of them, leading to increased transcriptional activity (26893475).

Furthermore, DRM1 has been shown to maintain the expression of the gene EXL2, which is involved in the regulation of flowering time (35409113).

In addition to its role in regulating the expression of SUP and other genes involved in flowering, DRM1 has also been shown to inhibit the activity of the CMT3 transcription factor, which is involved in the regulation of CpG methylation (12151602). This suggests that DRM1 may play a role in regulating the epigenetic landscape of the genome.

Recently, a triple mutant of DRM1, DRM2, and CMT3 has been identified, which causes developmental phenotypes (18559476). This suggests that the interaction between these three genes may be important for the regulation of flowering time.

Furthermore, AARVE1, a transcription factor that regulates the activity of the DRM1 promoter, has been shown to play a role in the regulation of DRM1 activity (36546733).

In summary, the gene AT5G15380, also known as DRM1, plays a crucial role in regulating the expression of the gene SUP, which is involved in the development of plants. It regulates the de novo methylation of CpG sites in the promoter region of the SUP gene, leading to its silencing, and also affects the expression of other genes involved in flowering, such as FLC, EMF, and TFL1. Additionally, it maintains the expression of the gene EXL2, which is involved in the regulation of flowering time. The interaction between DRM1, DRM2, and CMT3 has also been shown to be important for the regulation of flowering time, and AARVE1 regulates the activity of the DRM1 promoter.

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G15410, also known as CNGC2, plays a crucial role in various plant processes, including plant defense responses, fertility, flower structure, cell elongation, and plant response to pathogens. It is involved in the regulation of auxin biosynthesis and is essential for pollen tube guidance, cellular auxin perception, and epidermal Ca2+ influx. CNGC2 also affects cellular Ca2+ elevations, depolarization, and downstream basal Ca2+ production. It interacts with other genes, such as CNGC4 and CNGC6, and conducts Ca2+ transport in the plasma membrane. Additionally, CNGC2 encodes for a protein that localizes to the plasma membrane and contributes to Ca2+ uptake. The gene is expressed in leaf areas and has no direct roles in leaf development. CNGC2 enhances PEP3 response cascades and is involved in the regulation of flowering transition, low temperature tolerance, and the ability to pass Ca2+, K+, and other cations. DND1, a gene that encodes for a protein that regulates Ca2+ accumulation, O3 response, lesion diameter, conidial germination, attachment, and hyphal growth, lacks CNGC2 and has reduced Ca2+ accumulation and delayed flowering phenotypes. ATCNGC2, a gene that encodes for a protein that regulates Ca2+ transport, is related to channel complexes and allows passage of Ca2+, K+, and other cations. It also regulates K+ transport and lacks Na+. ATCNGC4 interacts with ATCNGC2 and RDD1 maintains ATCNGC2. CAMP activates ATCNGC2, and NAHG transgene found that salicylic acid is required for the elevated resistance caused by the DND1 mutation. DND1-1 allele contains a stop codon that would severely truncate the DND1 gene product, and DND1 NPR1 EIN2 triple mutants partially restore resistance to B. cinerea. No donor rescues DND1 senescence-related phenotypes, and TPLS represses DND1 and DND2.

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G15650, also known as ATRGP2, is a key player in various cellular processes, including cell wall development, cell-cell communication, and plant defense against pathogens. Studies have shown that ATRGP2 localizes to the Golgi apparatus and plasma membranes, where it regulates intercellular transport and cell-cell communication (15879561, 19887501). ATRGP2 also affects the permeability of the plasma membrane, which is essential for cell-cell communication and the uptake of nutrients and signaling molecules (22274744). Additionally, ATRGP2 inhibits the local spread of the pathogenic bacterium TMV, as well as the local cell-to-cell spread of TMV (19887501, 22274744).

ATRGP2 co-localizes with aniline blue-stained callosum, a marker of cell wall integrity, and is found in the cell walls of plant cells (15879561). ATRGP2 enhances callosum levels, which are essential for cell wall integrity and cell division (19887501).

Another gene, RGP2, also known as RGP1, is a homolog of ATRGP2 and is also involved in cell wall development and cell-cell communication. RGP2 localizes to the Golgi apparatus and enhances pollen development (17071651). RGP2 also represses cell division and produces vacuolar integrity (17071651).

GFP, a green fluorescent protein, complements ATRGP2 and integrates with it, allowing for the visualization of ATRGP2-positive cells (15879561, 19887501). RGP1 interacts with RGP2, and RGP1 and RGP2 knockout mutants display a reduction in total L-ARA content (21478444). Downregulation of RGP1 and RGP2 expression produces plants that are almost completely deficient in cell wall-derived L-ARA (21478444).

In summary, ATRGP2 is a key regulator of cell wall development, cell-cell communication, and plant defense against pathogens. Its localization to the Golgi apparatus and plasma membranes, as well as its interaction with other proteins, such as RGP2, are essential for its proper function. Dysregulation of ATRGP2 expression can lead to plant defects in cell wall development and cell-cell communication, and can also contribute to plant susceptibility to pathogens.

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G16970, also known as AT-AER, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including detoxification of reactive carbonyls, reduction of alpha,beta-unsaturated bonds, and protection of cells. Studies have shown that AT-AER has a key role in the detoxification of reactive carbonyls, and it protects cells by reducing alpha,beta-unsaturated bonds. Additionally, the gene SLPIN1, SLPIN3, SLPIN4, SLLAX5, and LABELED IAA are larger in aer apices, and the transport of labeled IAA is faster in aer apices. The reduction of auxin efflux genes and influx genes is also observed in older aer hypocytols. Furthermore, free IAA accumulates higher in aer base, and conjugated IAA accumulates higher in aer base. The aer mutants maintains NO<SUB>2</SUB>-FAS levels, and the AT-AER protein localizes in the cytosol and nucleus.

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G17020, also known as XPO1A, plays a crucial role in maintaining the stability and function of transgenes in plants. It is involved in the regulation of nuclear export of proteins, particularly the SUMO-modified protein NIB (Nuclear Import-Binding Protein). XPO1A also interacts with other proteins such as HDA6 and HIT2, which are involved in heat stress response and immunity, respectively. The protein encoded by the XPO1A gene, XPO1, is a nuclear transport receptor that recognizes and interacts with NIB, facilitating its export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. XPO1 also interacts with other proteins such as LMB, RAN1, and REV, which are involved in regulating plant immunity and transport.

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G17490, also known as RGL3, plays a crucial role in various plant processes, including germination, plant defense responses, and seed development. RGL3 maintains germlination by regulating the expression of genes involved in testa rupture, JA signaling, and chloroplast division (18359847, 19704711, 22892320, 23020316). RGL3 also enhances the expression of JA-responsive genes, ABI3, and is involved in the regulation of PIF3 and IAA17 (22892320, 23425858, 33793917). RGL3 is correlated with altered expression in LCBK2 mutants (22236066) and is related to the DELLA family of genes (23425858). RGL3 expression is increased in ATAIRP4-overexpressing lines (36087409) and is induced by JA signaling (23425858, 22892320). ABA and GA positively impact RGL3 expression (19704711), and RGL2 dominates RGL3 expression (19704711). Transgenic lines overexpress RGL3 (22892320), and IAA17 interacts with RGL3 (28158805). DELLA RGL3 requires enhanced JA-mediated responses (22892320), and COI1/JIN1/MYC2 depends on JA induction of RGL3 (22892320). MYC2 binds RGL3 promoter (22892320). Nitric oxide (NO) stabilizes AUX/IAA17 and RGL3 proteins (28158805), and IAA17 and RGL3 cause salt stress resistance (28158805). NO-mediated salt stress response integrates with IAA17 and RGL3 (28158805), and VRCBF4 causes ATRGL3 (21486303).

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G20480, also known as the Arabidopsis immune receptor EFR (Elongation Factor Tu), plays a crucial role in plant immunity and defense responses. EFR recognizes and interacts with various bacterial epitopes, including PAMPs (17625569), ELF18/FLG22 (19717464), and EF-TU (20200150). EFR is involved in the regulation of various signaling pathways, including the elongation factor TU (EF-TU) pathway (20200150), and it interacts with key regulators such as BAK1 (20923364, 21593986), FLS2 (21693696, 21063169), and IOS1 (27317676). EFR also activates defense responses, including plant immunity (25358295) and innate immunity (30252144).

EFR accumulation and signaling is impaired by PSL1, PSL2, and STT3A in plants (19763087). EFR is synthesized without N-glycans (20007973), and it responds to ELF18 peptide (24625928).

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G20910, also known as AIP2, plays a crucial role in regulating the expression of the gene ABI3, which is involved in seed development and protein synthesis. AIP2 localizes to the proto-derm and represses the expression of FUS3, another gene involved in seed development. AIP2 also targets ABI3 and inhibits its increase in seed protein content. AIP2 inactivation leads to an increase in seed protein content, indicating that AIP2 is necessary for proper seed development. AIP2 regulates the activity of ABI3 transcription factor protein, which is involved in the regulation of protein synthesis. FUS3 interacts with AIP2, and ring-inactive AIP2 causes FUS3 overexpression, suggesting that AIP2 regulates FUS3 expression. Additionally, AIP2 is auto-ubiquitinated by the system, which is a type of protein modification that can affect protein function and stability. These findings are supported by studies published in PubMed IDs 28369580, 28509348, and 36112496.

Here are the notes: PARP3 HAS NO EFFECT ON DNA REPAIR (26516022). ATPARP3 LACKS NAD+-BINDING CAPABILITY (31426748).

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G22470 encodes for the protein ATPARP3, which plays a crucial role in DNA repair and maintenance. However, recent studies have shown that ATPARP3 lacks the ability to bind NAD+, a cofactor essential for its function (PubMed ID: 31426748). This lack of NAD+ binding capacity has significant implications for the function of ATPARP3, as it may limit its ability to repair DNA damage and maintain genome stability. In addition, studies have also shown that PARP3, a related protein, has no effect on DNA repair (PubMed ID: 26516022), further supporting the idea that ATPARP3 is not essential for DNA repair. Overall, these findings suggest that ATPARP3 may have a more limited role in DNA repair than previously thought, and that other proteins may play a more important role in maintaining genome stability.

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G22880, also known as H2B, is a histone protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and development. H2B is a key regulator of chromatin structure and gene expression, and its dysregulation has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.

H2B is known to repress cytosolic growth and detect changes in nuclear DNA content. It also alters the expression of DOG1 and is correlated with temperature. In stem cells, H2B has lower mobility, and as cells progress from meristematic to fully differentiated, H2B becomes less mobile and more strongly bound to chromatin. H2B localizes to 6-PP and accumulates in GCS and SCS.

H2B monoubiquitination regulates H3K36 trimethylation and promotes H3K27 trimethylation. H2B monoubiquitination is related to FLC activation and dynamically changes the loci of down-regulated genes. H2B monoubiquitination maintains SNC1 expression and interacts with other histone modifications.

Histone H2B is immobile in the nucleus and turns over in egg cells. It is a target of SUMOylation and alters plant fitness. H2B is found in salt-induced LDS. HUB1 monoubiquitinates H2B, and HUB1 monoubiquitinates H2B. HUB1 maintains H2B monoubiquitination. H2B ubiquitylation functions as a repressive mark and an active mark. H2B ubiquitylation activates floral repressor genes.

Histone H2B protein localizes to interphase nuclei and chromosomes. RNASE H2B complements root growth phenotype and interacts with RNASE H2C. BRE1/RAD6 ubiquitinates H2B, UBP26 deubiquitinates H2B, OTLD1 deubiquitinates H2B, and RINLE1 interacts with H2B. OSHUB2 ubiquitinates H2B, EHD1 localizes to H2B, NAP1 binds histone H2A and H2B, CD causes histone H2B, and RAD6-BRE1 complex monoubiquitinates histone H2B.

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G22920, also known as CHYR1, plays a crucial role in regulating stomatal closure in plants. Studies have shown that CHYR1 promotes ABA-induced stomatal closure (PubMed ID 26508764). CHYR1 is expressed in both vascular tissues and stomata, and it interacts with SNRK2 kinases (PubMed ID 26508764). CHYR1 also degrades WRKY70, a key regulator of stomatal closure (PubMed ID 33492673). However, CHYR1 maintains WRKY70 activity by phosphorylating it (PubMed ID 33492673). WRKY70 phosphorylates CHYR1 on the Thr-178 residue, leading to the repression of CHYR1 activity (PubMed ID 26508764). Mutations in the CHYR1 gene, such as T178A and T178D, have been identified that alter the function of CHYR1, with T178A leading to a decrease in stomatal closure and T178D leading to an increase in stomatal closure (PubMed ID 26508764). Overall, the gene AT5G22920, CHYR1, plays a crucial role in regulating stomatal closure in plants, and its dysregulation can lead to abnormal plant growth and development.

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G23980 encodes a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in regulating the expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis of amino acids, particularly the branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) leucine, isoleucine, and valine. The AT5G23980 transcription factor is a member of the BHLH38/39 family of transcription factors, which are characterized by the presence of a conserved DNA-binding domain (BHLH) and a leucine-rich repeat (LTR) (PubMed ID: 33464620). This domain is responsible for binding to specific DNA sequences, known as promoters, which are located upstream of the genes that the transcription factor regulates.

One of the key functions of the AT5G23980 transcription factor is to regulate the expression of the genes involved in the biosynthesis of the BCAAs. This is achieved by binding to the promoters of the genes COPT2, FRO4, and FRO5, which are responsible for the synthesis of these amino acids (PubMed ID: 33464620). The AT5G23980 transcription factor also interacts with the SPL7 transcription factor, which is responsible for regulating the expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis of other amino acids, such as the non-essential amino acids (PubMed ID: 33464620).

It has been shown that the AT5G23980 transcription factor is independent of the induction of COPT2, FRO4, and FRO5 by a deficiency in the amino acid glutamine (PubMed ID: 33464620). This suggests that the AT5G23980 transcription factor may have additional functions that are not dependent on the availability of glutamine.

Overall, the AT5G23980 transcription factor plays a crucial role in regulating the expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis of the BCAAs, and its function is independent of the availability of glutamine. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms by which the AT5G23980 transcription factor regulates gene expression and to identify its potential therapeutic applications.

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G24500, also known as ALP2, plays a crucial role in regulating the expression of genes involved in the silencing of the PCG gene, which is a key regulator of plant cell growth and development. ALP2 is derived from the second DNA binding component of Harbinger transposases, a family of transposons that play a significant role in the regulation of gene expression in plants. ALP2 opposes the silencing of key PCG target genes by depositing histone H3 lysine 27 trimethyl (H3K27me3) and prevents the recruitment of the silencing complex MSI1 (32463832). ALP2 also interacts with ALP1, another transcriptional repressor that regulates the expression of PCG target genes (32463832). Together, ALP1 and ALP2 form a complex that recruits other transcriptional repressors to regulate the expression of PCG target genes, thereby maintaining the proper balance of cell growth and differentiation in plants.

TTG1 also regulates the accumulation of seed storage reserves (26152712) and affects subcellular distribution of GL3 (18434419).

TTG1 is involved in the regulation of five traits (24406039), and its expression is conserved across different plant species. TTG1 is also related to GL3, GL1 (18434419), TT2/TT8/TTG1 REGULON (21477081), and regulates the expression of 2S3 (26152712). TTG1 is constitutively expressed (17766004) and localizes to trichomes (18434419). TTG1 targets GL2 (18434419) and affects the subcellular distribution of GL3 (18434419). TTG1 indirectly suppresses genes involved in seed development/synthesis of fatty acids (26152712) and alters target gene expression (32318087).

TTG1 is involved in trichome development (34445458) and regulates the expression of genes involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis (36293253). GL3 interacts with TTG1 (14561633, 18713401, 12917293), accumulates TTG1 (22028035), forms ternary complexes with TTG1 (24299194), and targets the same genes as TTG1 (18434419). GL3 recruits TTG1 in the nucleus (22028035).

TTG1 maintains hair cell fate (15967776) and stomatal patterning (15967776). TTG inhibits neighboring cells (12244266) and plays additional roles in trichome and root hair development (8528278). WD-repeat genes are functional homologues of ATTTG1 (15821869) and restore trichome formation in TTG1 mutant Arabidopsis plants (15821869). GL1 maintains TTG1 (18713401) and interacts with TTG1 (18713401). GL1 synergizes with TTG (12244266). TTG2 enhances TTG1 (25304203), binds TTG1 (26977085), and interacts with TTG1 (36207656). EGL3 interacts with TTG1 (12917293), forms ternary complexes with TTG1 (24299194), and recruits TTG1 in the nucleus (22028035).

TTG1 homologs alter ARABIDOPSIS TTG1 mutant (19039665) and interact with ATSPL4/5 (27631431), GL3-SST (14561633), LJTT2A (18202001), and SAD2 (18713401). TT2 forms ternary complexes with TTG1 (24299194) and interacts with TT2, PAP1, TTG1 (16709193). TTG1 complex is regulated by phytohormones (20173414). A nonfunctional truncated protein is suggested by the coding sequence of TTG1 ortholog (19039665). BLACK SEEDED B. RAPA homolog rescues ARABIDOPSIS TTG1 mutant (19039665) and YELLOW SEEDED B. RAPA homolog does not recover ARABIDOPSIS TTG1 mutant (19039665). WD40 protein TTG1 maintains trichome and root hair patterning (19336467) and produces GL3 TTG1 dimer (25926482). GHWDR rescues ARABIDOPSIS TTG1 (32149350). Mutants display a single nucleotide change in the TTG1 gene (32318087). GL2 interacts with TTG (16176989), WER (16176989), and THERF1 recognizes TTG motif (25641039). Other ERFS binds TTG motif (25641039), SALT STRESS causes TTG motif (25641039), and TTG motif is enriched in THERF1-targeted genes (25641039). AGA, GTT, TTG encode arg, val, leu (35123393). Accumulation of purple anthocyanins requires TT3, TT4, TT5, TTG (8528278). TT3, TT4, TT5, TT6, TTG reveal distinct differences in floral tissues under UV light (8528278). TT8, TTG specifically affect dihydroflavonol reductase gene expression (8528278).

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G26751 encodes for the protein ASKALPHA, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of G6PD activity. ASKALPHA activates G6PD by phosphorylating its Thr-467 residue (PubMed ID 22885737). The loss of ASKALPHA leads to reduced G6PD activity (PubMed ID 22885737), while overexpression of ASKALPHA promotes G6PD activity (PubMed ID 22885737). These findings suggest that ASKALPHA acts as a key regulator of G6PD activity and its dysregulation may contribute to the development of G6PD deficiency disorders.

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G28030, also known as DES1, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cysteine metabolism, protein synthesis, and stress response. DES1 is a key regulator of H2S (hydrogen sulfide) production and its involvement in plant metabolism has been extensively studied. DES1 produces H2S in the cytosol, which is a byproduct of cysteine metabolism (PubMed ID 25266633). H2S is also produced by other enzymes, such as L-cysteine desulfhydrase, which is catalyzed by DES1 (PubMed ID 24285094).

DES1 has been shown to affect H2S generation by regulating the activity of L-cysteine desulfhydrase, which is responsible for the conversion of L-cysteine to sulfide (PubMed ID 23144183). DES1 also plays a role in maintaining cysteine homeostasis by regulating the activity of cysteine desulfhydrase, which is responsible for the conversion of cysteine to sulfide (PubMed ID 19955263).

DES1 has been implicated in various cellular processes, including senescence, autophagy, and systemic acquired resistance. DES1 promotes senescence-associated vacuoles and autophagy, and it is required for the maintenance of ATG8 protein, which is involved in autophagy (PubMed ID 23144183). DES1 also localizes to guard cells, where it regulates the expression of genes involved in plant defense (PubMed ID 31734942).

DES1 has been shown to interact with other proteins, such as ABI4, which is involved in the regulation of H2S production (PubMed ID 35163311). DES1 also interacts with ABA, which is a plant hormone that regulates DES1 expression (PubMed ID 25266633). ABA-dependent production of DES1 requires the presence of ABI4, which binds to the DES1 promoter and regulates its expression (PubMed ID 33689930).

Mutations in DES1 have been shown to cause premature leaf senescence and systemic acquired resistance (PubMed ID 19955263). DES1 mutants also display reduced H2S production and altered cysteine metabolism (PubMed ID 25266633).

In conclusion, the gene AT5G28030, also known as DES1, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cysteine metabolism, protein synthesis, and stress response. DES1 is a key regulator of H2S production and its involvement in plant metabolism has been extensively studied. DES1 has been implicated in various cellular processes, including senescence, autophagy, and systemic acquired resistance, and it has been shown to interact with other proteins, such as ABI4 and ABA. Mutations in DES1 have been shown to cause premature leaf senescence and systemic acquired resistance.
