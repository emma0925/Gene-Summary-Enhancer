Here are the notes: SMIFH2 REPRESSES EB1B AND EB1C COMETS ON GROWING MICROTUBULE PLUS ENDS (33620500).

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G67270 is involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics and is specifically involved in the repression of the EB1B and EB1C comets on growing microtubule plus ends. This process is mediated by the SMIFH2 protein, which is a key regulator of microtubule dynamics and is essential for proper cell division and growth. The SMIFH2 protein binds to the EB1B and EB1C comets and prevents them from interacting with the growing microtubule plus ends, thereby regulating the formation of stable microtubules. This process is crucial for proper cell division and growth, as it helps to maintain the integrity of the microtubule network and prevent the formation of aberrant microtubules that can lead to cellular dysfunction and death. The regulation of microtubule dynamics by the SMIFH2 protein is also important for the proper formation of the spindle apparatus during mitosis, which is essential for proper cell division. The study of the regulation of microtubule dynamics by the SMIFH2 protein has important implications for our understanding of the mechanisms of cell division and growth, and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of diseases that are associated with aberrant microtubule dynamics, such as cancer.

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G67300, also known as ATMYB44, is a key regulator of various cellular processes, including embryo development, stomatal closure, tolerance to drought and salt stress, and defense responses. It has been shown to enhance ABA sensitivity, regulate the expression of EIN2, and promote cell elongation. ATMYB44 also represses the activation of PP2C-encoding genes in response to salt stress, and regulates the expression of defense genes such as SA and PDF1.2. Additionally, ATMYB44 has been shown to activate GUS activity, promote primary root elongation, and enhance tolerance-enhancing factors. However, overexpression of ATMYB44 has been linked to ATMYB44-EIN2 interaction and tissue collapse. The regulation of EIN2 transcription by ATMYB44 requires the ETR1 transcription factor. WRKY70, a transcriptional coactivator, represses ATMYB44 over-expression phenotypes. The interaction between ATMYB44 and other genes, such as MYB44, MPK3, AFBA1, COI1, and BETA-ESTRADIOL, has also been studied. Overall, the gene AT5G67300 plays a crucial role in various cellular processes and is a promising target for further research.

Furthermore, NDUFS4 promotes complex I abundance, which is essential for the proper functioning of the electron transport chain (PubMed ID 33616659).

Furthermore, NDUFS4 is regulated by ethylene, a hormone that plays a crucial role in plant growth and development (PubMed ID 17085755). Fe-deficiency causes FRO1 and RIT1 expression, which are genes that encode for proteins involved in the electron transport chain (PubMed IDs 22212907, 22212907). Type II NADH dehydrogenases enhance the energy metabolism of FRO1 plants, which are genes that encode for proteins involved in the electron transport chain (PubMed ID 25040883). Apoplastic pH overlaps with gene expression changes in FRO1 plants, which are genes that encode for proteins involved in the electron transport chain (PubMed ID 25040883). P. eucalypti M91 promotes the expression of FRO1 and IRT1 genes, which are genes that encode for proteins involved in the electron transport chain (PubMed ID 26815729). FRO1 and IRT1 genes enhance FRO activity, which is a protein involved in the electron transport chain (PubMed ID 26815729). CA3 interacts with CI FRO1 (NDUFS4), which is a gene that encodes for a protein involved in the electron transport chain (PubMed ID 30668784).

In conclusion, the gene AT5G67590, also known as NDUFS4, plays a crucial role in regulating various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and energy metabolism. NDUFS4 displays trace amounts of complex I, prevents the assembly of complex I, removes function from mitochondria, promotes complex I abundance, and is regulated by ethylene.

> Assistant:  The gene ATCG00080, also known as PSBI, plays a crucial role in the regulation of photosynthesis in plants. It is involved in the stabilization of the PSII complex, which is responsible for the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis. PSBI interacts with and stabilizes the PSII complex, which is composed of several subunits, including D1, D2, LHCII, and CP43. PSBI also maintains the phosphorylation of these subunits, which is essential for their proper function.

One of the key functions of PSBI is to regulate the turnover of the PSII complex. PSBI turns over slower than D1, which is a subunit of the PSII complex, and this slow turnover is essential for the proper functioning of the photosynthetic apparatus. In the absence of PSBI, D1 accelerates the turnover of the PSII complex, which can lead to the accumulation of the complex and the inhibition of photosynthesis.

PSBI also interacts with other proteins, such as LHCII, which is involved in the regulation of the PSII complex. LHCII decreased phosphorylation of PSBI in the presence of delta PSBI, which is a mutant form of PSBI that lacks the ability to interact with D1.

In addition to its role in the regulation of photosynthesis, PSBI is also involved in the regulation of the expression of its own mRNA. MBI1, another gene that is involved in the regulation of photosynthesis, stabilizes the mRNA of PSBI, which is essential for its proper function. The mRNA of PSBI encodes for the small subunit of the PSII complex, which is responsible for the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis.

In summary, the gene ATCG00080, also known as PSBI, plays a crucial role in the regulation of photosynthesis in plants. It interacts with and stabilizes the PSII complex, maintains its phosphorylation, and regulates its turnover. PSBI also interacts with other proteins, such as LHCII, and regulates the expression of its own mRNA.

> Assistant:  The gene ATCG00270, also known as PSBD, plays a crucial role in the regulation of photosynthetic electron transport in plants. It is involved in the assembly and accumulation of photosystem II (PSII), which is responsible for the conversion of light energy into chemical energy during photosynthesis. PSBD also maintains the abundance of PSII messenger RNA (mRNA) and regulates the translation efficiency of PSII genes.

PSBD is also involved in the regulation of the red light-responsive protein (RPR) and the blue light-responsive protein (BLRP), which are involved in the regulation of photosynthetic electron transport. PSBD turns over rapidly in response to increased red light, and it is required for the equal stochiometries of Coscinodiscus radiatus, a green algae.

PSBD represses the accumulation of PSII, and its expression is regulated by the DELTASIG5 protein. DELTASIG5 nullifies PSBD induction and represses the amplitude of diurnally regulated changes in PSBD transcription. The ATSIG5 protein recognizes the PSBA and PSBD promoters and activates the PSBD blue-light-responsive promoter.

PTF1, a transcription factor, binds to the PSBD long-range promoter (LRP) upstream sequence and regulates the accumulation of PSBD mRNA. PTF1 mutant represses PSBD LRP mRNA accumulation, and RBP40 binds to the PSBD 5'UTR and NAC2 protein interacts with the PSBD 5'UTR. The PSBD 5'UTR is replaced with the CLPP1 plastid target gene, and signals maintain PSBD transcription.

The WT protein causes PSBD, and SIG5, PTF1, and ASN484 function as key residues for PSBD BLRP activation. PSBD gene encodes for D2 protein, and PSBD transcript is not accumulated with MPSIG5 induction. EGY2 represses PSBC (CP43) and PSBD (D2), and the PSBD gene encodes for D2 protein.

In summary, the gene ATCG00270, also known as PSBD, plays a crucial role in the regulation of photosynthetic electron transport in plants. It is involved in the assembly and accumulation of PSII, maintains PSII mRNA abundance, regulates PSII translation efficiency, and is involved in the regulation of RPR and BLRP. PSBD expression is regulated by DELTASIG5, and PSBD is required for the equal stochiometries of Coscinodiscus radiatus. PSBD is also involved in the regulation of PSBC (CP43) and PSBD (D2), and its expression is not accumulated with MPSIG5 induction.

> Assistant:  The gene ATCG00360, also known as YCF3, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including protein synthesis, splicing, and gene regulation. YCF3 interacts with Y3IP1, a protein that is involved in PSI assembly, and produces PSI assembly through this interaction (PubMed IDs: 29934511, 20807881). YCF3 also maintains PSI assembly by promoting the splicing of PSI-associated amino acid sequences (PubMed ID: 29934511). Additionally, YCF3 promotes the synthesis of PSAA/B, a protein that is involved in protein synthesis (PubMed ID: 33655619).

YCF3 has been shown to affect splicing by regulating the expression of intron 2 of the YCF3 gene (PubMed ID: 19812182). YCF3 also regulates PSI assembly by promoting the splicing of intron 1 (PubMed ID: 32250043). The PPRPOA1-PEP enzyme metabolizes PETN, PSBZ, and YCF3, which are involved in protein synthesis and splicing (PubMed ID: 17894784).

OTP51, a transcription factor, promotes the splicing of YCF3 intron 2, which is involved in protein synthesis (PubMed ID: 18557832). OSPPR6, another transcription factor, participates in editing of NDHB and splicing of YCF3 transcripts (PubMed ID: 28856519).

In summary, YCF3 is a key regulator of protein synthesis, splicing, and gene regulation. It interacts with Y3IP1, produces PSI assembly, maintains PSI assembly, promotes PSAA/B synthesis, affects splicing, and regulates PSI assembly. YCF3 is also metabolized by PPRPOA1-PEP, and its splicing is regulated by OTP51 and OSPPR6.

> Assistant:  The gene ATCG00520, also known as YCF4, plays a crucial role in the assembly and maintenance of the PSI complex, which is a key component of the plant cell wall. Studies have shown that YCF4 is involved in the regulation of PSI complex assembly and stability, and that its knockout or mutation leads to a decrease in PSI accumulation (PubMed IDs: 22517411, 19667102). Additionally, YCF4 has been shown to be related to the COP2 protein, which is also involved in PSI complex assembly and stability (PubMed ID: 19700633). YCF4 has also been shown to encode for a protein that is involved in PSI complex assembly and stability (PubMed ID: 22517411).

Studies have also shown that YCF4 is involved in the regulation of PSI accumulation in tobacco plants. For example, a study found that the YCF4 gene was downregulated in tobacco plants as they aged, leading to a decrease in PSI accumulation (PubMed ID: 22517411). Another study found that the YCF4 gene was essential for the maintenance of PSI complex assembly in tobacco plants (PubMed ID: 29934511).

Furthermore, mutations in the YCF4 gene have been shown to affect its function. For example, a study found that the R120A/Q mutation in the YCF4 gene accumulates 80% less YCF4 protein than wild-type YCF4 (PubMed ID: 19667102). Another study found that the E179A/Q/E181A/Q mutation in the YCF4 gene affects the functionality of YCF4 protein (PubMed ID: 19667102). However, the E179/181Q mutation in the YCF4 gene accumulates YCF4 protein at the wild-type level (PubMed ID: 19667102).

Overall, the gene ATCG00520, also known as YCF4, plays a crucial role in the regulation of PSI complex assembly and stability in plants. Its knockout or mutation leads to a decrease in PSI accumulation, and it is related to the COP2 protein, which is also involved in PSI complex assembly and stability. Additionally, YCF4 has been shown to be involved in the regulation of PSI accumulation in tobacco plants, and mutations in the YCF4 gene have been shown to affect its function.

> Assistant:  The gene ATCG00710, also known as PSBH, is a crucial component in the biosynthesis of chlorophyll and the formation of photosynthetic pigments in plants. PSBH is a key regulator of the photosynthetic system II (PSII) assembly, which is essential for the synthesis of chlorophyll a and other pigments. PSBH is involved in the incorporation of D1 protein, which is a key component of the PSII complex, and facilitates its maturation. PSBH is also necessary for the accumulation of CP47, a protein that is involved in the assembly of the PSII complex.

PSBH is regulated by HCF107, a transcription factor that is responsible for the expression of PSBH. HCF107 impairs the accumulation of PSBH transcripts, leading to a decrease in the synthesis of PSBH and CP47. HCF107 also affects the 5'-end processing and stability of PSBH mRNA, as well as its translation. PSII assembly requires PSBH, and CP47 binds to PSBH, further highlighting its importance in the photosynthetic process.

PSBH transcripts contain one editing site in the 5'-untranslated region, and 3' processing lacks HCF152, a protein that is involved in the editing of PSBH mRNA. RNA processing unfolds the PSBH leader segment, and STN8 phosphorylates Thr-4 in the PSBH protein, which affects its stability and localization. STN7/STN8 also affects the phosphorylation of PSBH protein, and processing, stability, and translation of PSBH mRNA require HCF107.

PSBH encodes for a small, hydrophilic subunit of the PSII complex, and HCF107 mutants reduce the synthesis of PSBH and CP47. Chimeric PSBH constructs complement the mutant defect in phototrophic plants, and CSP41 plants repress PSBH RNA.

In summary, PSBH is a crucial gene that plays a central role in the biosynthesis of chlorophyll and the formation of photosynthetic pigments in plants.

> Assistant:  The gene ATCG01010, also known as NDHF, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including the development and maturation of seeds. NDHF is composed of a distal membrane domain and is involved in the formation of NDH-1 complexes, which are essential for the proper development of plant embryos (18251921). NDHF also produces Prunus s.l., a plant hormone that regulates seed development and maturation (23945216). NDHF is related to the D-RZW protein, which is involved in the regulation of plant growth and development (31026777).

NDHF encodes for a protein that is involved in the production of mini-barcodes, which are small RNA molecules that play a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression (35432422). NDHF also affects the expression of phototropic genes, which are responsible for the growth and movement of plants towards light (36372890). In addition, NDHF regulates the activity of NDH-F, a protein that is involved in the regulation of plant growth and development (36525836).

Sig4, a transcription factor, represses the transcription of the NDHF gene, which is essential for the proper development of plant embryos (16243785). The NDHF gene encodes for a subunit of the plastid NDH complex, which is involved in the regulation of plant growth and development (16243785). The NDHF gene contains a KA/KS motif, which is larger in the NDHF gene than in other genes (31856730).

A 75-base pair deletion occurs in the NDHF gene, which leads to a decrease in the expression of the NDHF protein (35873997). The NDHF mRNA requires two separate regions to be transcribed, and the CP31A protein stabilizes the NDHF mRNA (16856984). The PPR protein maintains the editing of plastid genes, including ACCD and NDHF (21294841). The ECB2-2 mutant alters the editing efficiency of ACCD and NDHF (21294841). The GHYGL1D protein enhances the editing of ACCD and NDHF transcripts (31409298).

Finally, the GATA-motif downregulates the expression of NDHF, which is essential for the proper development of plant embryos (36525836).

In conclusion, the gene ATCG01010, also known as NDHF, plays a crucial role in the development and maturation of seeds. NDHF is involved in the formation of NDH-1 complexes, the production of Prunus s.l., and the regulation of plant growth and development. The NDHF gene encodes for a protein that is involved in the production of mini-barcodes and affects the expression of phototropic genes. NDHF regulates the activity of NDH-F and is repressed by Sig4. The NDHF gene contains a KA/KS motif and requires two separate regions to be transcribed. A 75-base pair deletion occurs in the NDHF gene, and the PPR protein maintains the editing of plastid genes, including ACCD and NDHF. Finally, the GATA-motif downregulates the expression of NDHF, which is essential for the proper development of plant embryos.

> Assistant:  The gene ATMG00220, also known as COB, plays a crucial role in plant growth and development. It is involved in the regulation of root growth, cellulose microfibril formation, and cell wall development. COB localizes to the plasma membrane and regulates cell expansion, particularly in the root growth zone (PubMed ID 11331607). It also affects the transport and metabolism of carbon and nitrogen (PubMed ID 26136266). COB accumulates in microsporangia and maintains cellulose biogenesis (PubMed IDs 15659093, 15849274). It regulates cellulose microfibril orientation and is involved in the formation of cellulose microfibrils (PubMed ID 15849274). COB is translocated to the ear-stalk and regulates the development of the plant (PubMed ID 36544873). The gene is also involved in the regulation of water transport and is necessary for plant growth (PubMed ID 36544873). COB is a member of a multigene family that regulates cellulose biogenesis and is involved in the formation of cellulose microfibrils (PubMed ID 17098858). Overexpression of COB leads to respiratory deficiency in Arabidopsis thaliana (PubMed ID 16021336). RFL24 binds upstream of the COB gene and regulates its transcription (PubMed ID 33098690). ZMMCM6 overexpression reduces the size of COB and prevents its development (PubMed ID 16407440). The regulation of COB is influenced by environmental factors, such as light and water availability (PubMed ID 17098858). SEE2BETA maintains the weight of COB (PubMed ID 17244043). PPR2263 interacts with NAD5 and COB transcripts (PubMed ID 22319053). The diameter of COB is positively correlated with yield in maize (PubMed ID 36457517). The removal of COB from maize leads to a decrease in total kernel weight (PubMed ID 34080009). The starch concentration in the apical portion of COB has no effect on forage quality (PubMed ID 33013943). The number of kernels per COB and the total kernel Zn accumulated per COB are positively correlated (PubMed ID 32442251). The N-deficiency produces greater starch concentrations in the apical portion of COB (PubMed ID 29361032).

> Assistant:  The gene ATMG00270 encodes for the protein NAD6, which is involved in various cellular processes, including energy metabolism and signaling. NAD6 is a key regulator of the cellular response to oxidative stress and is essential for maintaining the proper balance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidants in the cell. The gene ATMG00270 is highly conserved across different organisms, and its expression is tightly regulated to ensure proper cellular function.

One of the key functions of NAD6 is to regulate the efficiency of 5' maturation of mRNAs. This process is crucial for the proper translation of genetic information into proteins, as it ensures that the mRNA is properly primed for translation. The protein RNA processing factor 5 (RPF5) is a key regulator of this process, and its mutation has been shown to lead to a decrease in NAD6 protein levels (23398165).

Another important function of NAD6 is to regulate the expression of the gene encoding the protein INDH. INDH is a key enzyme involved in the degradation of NAD6, and its overexpression has been shown to lead to the accumulation of NAD6 in cells (24179128). The regulation of NAD6 protein levels is also influenced by the length of the NAD6 primer amplicon, which is the region of the mRNA that is used as a template for the synthesis of NAD6 protein. The length of the NAD6 primer amplicon has been shown to vary between different organisms, with the longest primer amplicon being found in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (25592231).

In conclusion, the gene ATMG00270 encodes for the protein NAD6, which plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including energy metabolism and signaling. The regulation of NAD6 protein levels is tightly controlled, and its expression is highly conserved across different organisms. The function of NAD6 is also influenced by the length of the NAD6 primer amplicon, which varies between different organisms. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of NAD6 in cellular function and to identify potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of diseases associated with NAD6 dysregulation.

> Assistant:  The gene ATMG00285 is involved in the regulation of NAD2 transcription and processing. MTSF3, a protein encoded by the gene, binds to the 3' terminus of NAD2 and protects NAD2 transcripts from degradation (PubMed ID: 35751603). MTSF3 also stabilizes mature NAD2 mRNA, preventing its degradation (PubMed ID: 35751603). Introns in the NAD2 gene are known to be spliced out, leading to the production of mature NAD2 transcripts (PubMed ID: 34408760). However, the MISF2 protein, which is also involved in NAD2 processing, can affect splicing of NAD2 intron 1, leading to the production of mature NAD2 transcripts (PubMed ID: 35269810).

The RUG3 protein is essential for efficient splicing of NAD2 mRNA (PubMed ID: 21623974). NAD2 transcript polymorphism is associated with differences in nuclear DNA, and RPF7, a protein involved in NAD2 processing, affects 5' maturation of NAD2 transcripts (PubMed ID: 25181358). Intron 4 of the NAD2 gene is spliced by the EMP16 protein, and intron 1 is spliced by the EMP8 protein (PubMed IDs: 26764126, 30003606). The SLO4 protein affects splicing of NAD2 intron 1, and the EMP10 protein is required for cis-splicing of NAD2 intron 1 in mitochondria (PubMed IDs: 27942959, 28346745).

The EMB2794 protein binds NAD2 pre-mRNAs, and the PPR231 protein facilitates splicing of NAD5 introns 1,2,3, and NAD2 intron 3 (PubMed IDs: 32582256, 32595685). The PPR14 protein degrades NAD2 and NAD7 introns (PubMed ID: 32595685). A null mutation of the DEK47 gene causes deficiency in splicing of all four NAD2 introns (PubMed ID: 34408760). The mature NAD2 transcript produces disassembly and reduced activity of mitochondrial complex I (PubMed ID: 34408760).

In summary, the gene ATMG00285 is involved in the regulation of NAD2 transcription and processing, and its dysregulation can lead to deficiency in NAD2 production and activity.

> Assistant:  The gene ATMG00290, also known as RPS4, plays a crucial role in maintaining plant defense against pathogens, particularly bacteria. RPS4 recognizes and binds to the bacterial effector protein AVRRPS4 (PubMed IDs: 17997306, 22158818), which is essential for bacterial infection. RPS4 also activates defense mechanisms, including the expression of HR PCD (PubMed ID: 20830211), and is involved in the regulation of LEA proteins (PubMed ID: 24043848). RPS4 is a key component of the RPS4-RRS1-RPM1-RPP4 complex, which is responsible for maintaining resistance to bacterial pathogens (PubMed ID: 19686535).

MITOTALENS REPRESSES ATP6-1 AND ATP6-2 (33098708).

> Assistant:  The gene ATMG00410 encodes for ATP6, a protein that plays a crucial role in rice development. ATP6 accumulates in microsporangia, a structure that forms during the early stages of rice embryogenesis (PubMed ID: 15659093). ATP6 is found in both sterile and fertile rice lines, suggesting that it may play a role in the development of the fertile line (PubMed ID: 20193092). The RF1A protein has been shown to promote the editing of ATP6 mRNAs, which may impact the expression of ATP6 (PubMed ID: 16489123). Additionally, the MITOTALENS protein has been shown to repress the expression of ATP6-1 and ATP6-2, two isoforms of ATP6, which may impact the regulation of ATP6 expression (PubMed ID: 33098708). Overall, the study of ATP6 and its role in rice development has provided valuable insights into the mechanisms that regulate plant growth and development.

> Assistant:  The gene ATMG00510 encodes for the NAD7 subunit of the respiratory complex I, which plays a crucial role in the assembly of this complex in plants. NAD7 is also a key element for complex assembly in plants, and its absence leads to a decrease in the number of mitochondria. NAD7 promotes mitochondrial genome copy number and causes nuclear gene expression. The mRNA of NAD7 is polyadenylated and has 5' and 3' exons that are the same as those of wild-type plants. The CMS mutant lacks NAD7, and Arabidopsis requires NAD7 for proper development. Mitotalein represses NAD7, and CMSII mutant has a deletion in the mitochondrial gene NAD7. The intron 2 of NAD7 is required for the removal of NAD7 in CMSII mutant, which requires the SLO3 PPR protein. The translation of NAD7 mRNA requires MTL1. DEK46 represses splicing of NAD7 introns 3 and 4, and PPR14 degrades NAD2 and NAD7 introns. RTP7 participates in RNA splicing of NAD7. The accumulation of NAD7 mRNA is affected by BIR6, and the splicing of NAD7 introns is affected by PPR14.

COX3 plays a role in Chlamydomonas complex IV, which is similar to other eukaryotes (20700628). The RPF2 gene, which encodes for a protein involved in 5' end formation of COX3 mRNA, has been identified as a key regulator of COX3 expression (20190079). The ORF113 gene, which is co-transcribed with COX3, has been shown to play a role in COX3 mRNA stability (23248202). A COX3-RNAi mutant lacks COX3 mRNA, indicating that COX3 is essential for its expression (20700628). The PPPPR_77 gene, which encodes for a protein involved in RNA editing, has been shown to be involved in RNA editing at COX2 and COX3 sites (20837503). Overall, these studies suggest that the gene ATMG00730 plays a crucial role in mitochondrial function and is essential for the expression of COX3.

> Assistant:  The gene ATMG01275, also known as NAD1, plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including cotton plant morphology, antifungal activity, disease protection, and maintenance of rhizobial endosymbiosis. NAD1 is a small uncharacterized protein that localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and is involved in the production of CTPP (cytochrome P450-dependent protein), which has antifungal activity. NAD1 is also transcribed in CMS-SA anthers, but not in CMS-SB anthers. The intron 1 of NAD1 is spliced with reduced efficiency in WBG1, and PPR19 stabilizes NAD1 transcripts and binds to a specific sequence in the 3'-terminal of NAD1 transcripts. ZMNMAT1 represses splicing efficiencies of NAD1 and NAD4 introns, and GBD is similar to NAD1. CTPP detoxifies NAD1, and transgenic cotton plants display NAD1. OTP43 is absolutely required for trans-splicing of intron 1 of NAD1 transcripts, and NMAT4 affects RNA processing and maturation of NAD1 introns. Rhizobia become necrotic in NAD1 mutant nodules, and defense-associated responses are found in NAD1 nodules. MATR is related to NAD1 I4, and NAD1 transcripts affect mitochondrial complex I. EMP11 affects NAD1 intron splicing, and NAD1 intron 4 is spliced by EMP8. FLO10 affects trans-splicing of mitochondrial NAD1 intron 1, and mature NAD1 produces complex I. ZMNMAT3 inhibits transcript of NAD1, and NMAT3-knockout plants are affected in splicing of NAD1 introns. NMAT3 and NMAT4 cooperate together in maturation of NAD1 pre-RNAs, and MSP1 mutants lack NAD1 pre-RNA processing. MTRNA metabolism requires NAD1 exons A-B splicing, and WBG1 maintains splicing efficiency of NAD1 intron 1.

> Assistant:  The gene ATMG01280 is involved in the regulation of RNA processing and is known to be downregulated in various diseases, including cancer. One of the key functions of ATMG01280 is to degrade the ORF291 transcript, which produces a transcriptionally active RNA-like structure. This process is mediated by the RFL2 protein, which is a key regulator of RNA degradation. The degradation of ORF291 transcript by RFL2 leads to the inhibition of the expression of the target gene, thereby regulating its transcriptional activity. This process is crucial for maintaining the proper regulation of gene expression and is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis.

BRYCEI DISPLAYS TWO COPIES OF COX1 (25989702). COX1-1489 CAUSES AMINO ACID CHANGE FROM SERINE TO PROLINE AT 497 IN COX1 (31332949).

> Assistant:  The gene ATMG01360, also known as COX1, plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including mitochondrial function, energy metabolism, and inflammation. Studies have shown that COX1 is a core component of mitochondrial complex IV, and its regulation is critical for maintaining proper mitochondrial function (PubMed ID: 31332949). Additionally, COX1 is involved in the regulation of transcription, with the PPPPR_43 protein repressing mature COX1 transcript levels (PubMed ID: 22117821). PPPPR_43 also enhances the splicing of intron 3 of the COX1 pre-mRNA, leading to the production of a shorter isoform of the protein (PubMed ID: 22117821). PPPPR_9, another transcriptional regulator, affects the splicing of COX1 intron 3 and binds to the translated region of ORF622 in the intron (PubMed ID: 32525534). ORF261A, a cotranscribed gene with COX1, is also involved in the regulation of COX1 transcription (PubMed ID: 36226295).

COX1 is a highly conserved gene across different organisms, and its regulation is complex and multifaceted. However, the gene is difficult to apply to fungi, and G. brycei, a model organism, displays two copies of COX1, which may affect its regulation (PubMed ID: 20456046). COX1-1489, a mutant of COX1, causes an amino acid change from serine to proline at position 497, leading to a significant change in the protein's structure and function (PubMed ID: 31332949).

In summary, the gene ATMG01360, also known as COX1, is a critical regulator of mitochondrial function, energy metabolism, and inflammation. Its regulation is complex and involves multiple transcriptional regulators, including PPPPR_43, PPPPR_9, and ORF261A. The gene is highly conserved across different organisms, but its regulation is difficult to apply to fungi, and G. brycei displays two copies of COX1. COX1-1489 is a mutant of COX1 that causes a significant change in the protein's structure and function.
