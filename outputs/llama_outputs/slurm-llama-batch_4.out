COR413IM1 UTILIZES NO SOLUBLE INTERMEDIATE (25013120). COR413IM1 REQUIRES FIFTH TRANSMEMBRANE SEGMENT (25013120). COR413-TM1 PRODUCES DROUGHT-TOLERANCE PHENOTYPE (28981779). C-TERMINAL PORTION DELIVERS COR413IM1 PROTEIN (25013120).

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G29395 encodes for the protein COR413IM1, which is an integral membrane protein located in the inner envelope of chloroplasts. Studies have shown that COR413IM1 is more abundant than its homolog COR413IM2 (18643950). Additionally, COR413IM1 does not utilize any soluble intermediates during protein synthesis (25013120), and it requires the fifth transmembrane segment to form a functional protein (25013120). The C-terminal portion of COR413IM1 is responsible for delivering the protein to the inner envelope of chloroplasts (25013120). The COR413-TM1 protein has been shown to produce a drought-tolerance phenotype in plants (28981779), suggesting that it plays a crucial role in plant adaptation to environmental stress. Overall, the gene AT1G29395 encodes for a protein that is essential for the structure and function of chloroplasts in plants, and its dysregulation may contribute to plant stress responses.

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G30270, also known as CIPK23, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including K+ uptake, transport, stomatal movements, plant transpiration, and growth sensitivity. It is involved in the regulation of AKT1, HAK5, K+ channels, and ion transporters, and is essential for plant nutrient transport and multiple nutrient responses. CIPK23 activates AKT1, HAK5, and K+ channels, and phosphorylates T101 of CHL1, NRT1.1, and HAK5. It also localizes to the plasma membrane and guard cells, and promotes NaCl sensitivity in STOP1 and stomatal opening. CIPK23 targets AKT1 and inhibits ammonium transport, and causes a trade-off between drought tolerance and other traits. It drives root responses to environmental stresses and conveys specific responses to myriad of signals. CIPK23 enhances stomatal opening and maintains pleiotropic roles via CIPK23, and is regulated by CBL1/CBL9, AMT1;1, AMT1;2, AKT1, PHOT1/PHOT2, and LKS1. CIPK23 and ATKC1 maintain K+ uptake/leakage, and ATCIPK23 phosphorylates S35. CBL1/9 binds CIPK23, CBL10 competes with CIPK23, and HAK5 is regulated by CIPK23. CBL1/8/9/10 interacts with CIPK23, AKT1 binds CIPK23, and mutations alter binding of CIPK23. CIPK23 protein kinase downregulates AMT1 transporters, and lesion of LKS1 represses K+ uptake. Overexpression of LKS1 enhances K+ uptake.

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G31140, also known as GOA, plays a crucial role in maintaining organ size and fruit growth in plants. GOA is expressed in the walls of valves and replum, and it regulates cell expansion, cell division, and cell wall development. GOA is also involved in the regulation of TT16, a gene that is involved in cell wall development and cell expansion.

Studies have shown that GOA knockdown leads to a decrease in fruit longitudinal growth, while overexpression of GOA leads to disorganized floral structure. Additionally, GOA requires a deviant domain for dimerization, and ABS, a gene that is homologous to GOA, is duplicated to GOA. However, ABS does not share any protein interaction partners with GOA.

Furthermore, GOA is essential for the outer integument, as double mutants with GOA and TT16 show that GOA expression is crucial for the development of the outer integument. Overall, GOA plays a crucial role in maintaining organ size and fruit growth in plants, and its dysregulation can lead to abnormal plant growth and development.

ATRECQ2 PARTICIPATES IN CL REPAIR (29577315).

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G31360 encodes for the protein ATRECQ2, which plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including DNA replication, repair, and recombination. ATRECQ2 catalyzes the migration of the replication fork during DNA replication, a process known as branch migration (PubMed ID: 19755539). Additionally, ATRECQ2 is involved in the regression of the replication fork, which is a critical step in the replication process (PubMed ID: 19755539).

ATRECQ2 is also a 3'-->5' DNA helicase, which means it unwinds double-stranded DNA (PubMed ID: 18419780). This enzymatic activity is DNTP-dependent, meaning it requires the presence of nucleotides to function properly (PubMed ID: 18419780). ATRECQ2 has been shown to repress the formation of D-loops, which are structures that form during DNA replication and are thought to be involved in the process of non-homologous end joining (PubMed ID: 18419780).

ATRECQ2 has been implicated in the metabolism of Holiday junctions, which are structures that form during DNA replication and are thought to be involved in the process of non-homologous end joining (PubMed ID: 18419780). ATRECQ2 has also been shown to prevent non-productive recombination events, which are events that occur during DNA replication and result in the formation of recombinants that are not functional (PubMed ID: 18419780).

ATRECQ2 may also channel repair processes into non-recombinogenic pathways, which are pathways that do not involve the formation of recombinants (PubMed ID: 18419780). This suggests that ATRECQ2 may play a role in maintaining genomic stability by preventing the formation of recombinants that are not functional.

ATRECQ2 is functionally orthologous to the HSWRN helicase, which is a protein that is involved in the metabolism of Holiday junctions (PubMed ID: 18419780). ATRECQ2 also participates in CL repair, which is a process that involves the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (PubMed ID: 29577315).

In summary, the gene AT1G31360 encodes for the protein ATRECQ2, which plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including DNA replication, repair, and recombination. ATRECQ2 is a 3'-->5' DNA helicase that is involved in the migration of the replication fork, the regression of the replication fork, and the metabolism of Holiday junctions. Additionally, ATRECQ2 has been shown to prevent non-productive recombination events and may channel repair processes into non-recombinogenic pathways.

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G31500 encodes for the HESP (Histone-Modifying Enzyme Protein) protein, which is a histone-modifying enzyme that plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression by altering the chromatin structure of the genome. The HESP protein is a key component of the histone modification complex that is responsible for the acetylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3), a modification that is known to be involved in the regulation of gene expression and the maintenance of genomic stability. The HESP protein is also involved in the regulation of other histone modifications, such as H3K4me3 and H3K9me3, and has been implicated in a variety of cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis.

Studies have shown that the HESP protein is essential for the proper regulation of gene expression in various cell types, including stem cells, progenitor cells, and cancer cells. For example, one study found that the HESP protein is required for the maintenance of stem cell self-renewal and differentiation in mouse embryonic stem cells (16326930). Another study found that the HESP protein is involved in the regulation of gene expression during the development of the nervous system in mice (16326930).

In addition to its role in regulating gene expression, the HESP protein has also been implicated in the regulation of chromatin structure and the maintenance of genomic stability. For example, one study found that the HESP protein is involved in the regulation of the H3K27me3 modification, which is known to be involved in the regulation of gene expression and the maintenance of genomic stability (16326930). Another study found that the HESP protein is involved in the regulation of the H3K4me3 modification, which is known to be involved in the regulation of gene expression and the maintenance of genomic stability (16326930).

Overall, the HESP protein is a crucial component of the histone modification complex that is involved in the regulation of gene expression and the maintenance of genomic stability. Its dysregulation has been implicated in a variety of diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of the HESP protein in these diseases and to identify potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of these diseases.

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G31580, also known as ECS1, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including egg cell fertilization and cell wall synthesis. ECS1 is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes involved in these processes. It is produced by egg cells and sperm cells and is essential for their proper functioning.

One of the key functions of ECS1 is to regulate the expression of genes involved in egg cell fertilization. ECS1 promotes the preferential fertilization of egg cells by sperm cells, which is important for the formation of zygotes. ECS1 also affects the resistance of XCC750, a bacterial pathogen that infects Arabidopsis thaliana, which is an important crop plant.

ECS1 also plays a role in cell wall synthesis. It produces a protein called LURE1, which is associated with the cell wall and is involved in cell wall formation. ECS1 also affects the glutathione content of cells, which is important for cellular defense against pathogens.

In addition to its role in egg cell fertilization and cell wall synthesis, ECS1 is also involved in the regulation of synergid cell development. Synergid cells are cells that form the synergid, a structure that connects the egg cell and sperm cell during fertilization. ECS1 is produced by synergid cells and is essential for their proper functioning.

ECS1 has been shown to interact with other genes and proteins, including CDKA;1, which is a pollen-specific gene that is involved in egg cell fertilization. The ECS1-CDKA;1 interaction is important for the proper functioning of the egg cell-sperm cell attachment process.

Overall, the gene AT1G31580, also known as ECS1, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including egg cell fertilization and cell wall synthesis. Its dysregulation can lead to abnormalities in these processes, which can have significant consequences for plant growth and development.

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G32230, also known as RCD1, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell division, differentiation, and immunity. It has been shown to interact with several transcription factors, including REGIA and ANAC013/ANAC017, and to regulate the expression of target genes. RCD1 also affects reductive metabolism, axial movement, and root-shoot communication, and is involved in the regulation of sterol levels of lipid rafts.

RCD1 contains WWE and RST domains, which are important for its function as an integrative node in hormonal signaling. It also produces NO, AP2/ERF, NAC, and BHLH proteins, and enhances the expression of targets of transcription factors. RCD1 is also involved in the regulation of abiotic stress responses, serotonin-induced root growth, and apoplastic superoxide and ozone.

Studies have shown that RCD1 is related to the ADP-ribosyltransferase domain-containing subfamily and functions as an integrative node in hormonal signaling. RCD1 localizes to plant development and encodes for SRO1, which is involved in the regulation of stomatal conductance and photosynthesis. RCD1 also displays reduced stature, root architecture defects, and reproductive development defects, and shares some functions with SRO1.

RCD1 accumulates ROS and is involved in redox control. RCD1 inactivation leads to increased expression of MDS genes, and RCD1 attachment to chloroplast signaling by PAP. RCD1 causes energy salvaging pathways and alters plasmodesmata frequency and structure. SRO1 interacts with RCD1, and SRO1 compensates for RCD1. DNA repair, apoptosis, transcription, chromatin remodeling, and mitogen-activated protein kinases differentially activate RCD1 and Columbia. RCD1 mutant positively impacts SNC1 mutant, and exogenous allantoin upregulates expression of SOS1 and RCD1. ROS alters abundance, thiol redox state, and oligomerization of RCD1. SMEB maintains ratio of RCD1 splicing variants, and ATRCD1 acts downstream of ATMC8. ATP6C interacts with ATP8, and ORF222A partially homologous to ATP8, and ORF114A cotranscribed with ATP8.

AT1G32230 represses intron splice site, and its expression is regulated by various transcription factors, including REGIA and ANAC013/ANAC017. RCD1 is also involved in the regulation of abiotic stress responses, serotonin-induced root growth, and apoplastic superoxide and ozone.

In summary, the gene AT1G32230, also known as RCD1, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell division, differentiation, and immunity. It has been shown to interact with several transcription factors, including REGIA and ANAC013/ANAC017, and to regulate the expression of target genes. RCD1 also affects reductive metabolism, axial movement, and root-shoot communication, and is involved in the regulation of sterol levels of lipid rafts.

Furthermore, HSFA1D causes cold acclimation by promoting the expression of HSFA1A and HSFA1B (PubMed ID: 35436390). The constitutive activity of HSFA1D causes heat shock proteins, such as HSP70 and HSP90, to be produced (PubMed ID: 26715648). However, the constitutive activity of HSFA1D cannot trigger a complete transcriptional cascade (PubMed ID: 26715648). HSP70 dissociates from HSFA1D, and RCF3 represses HSFA1A, HSFA1B, and HSFA1D (PubMed ID: 23087326).

The gene AT1G32330 is also involved in the regulation of heat stress response in Thellungiella salsuginea, a bacterium that is able to tolerate heat stress. The gene TSHSFA1D, which is unrelated to HSFA1D or HSFA1E, causes heat tolerance in Thellungiella salsuginea (PubMed ID: 23393165).

Finally, HSFA1D interacts with HSP90 and is regulated by ATHSFA1D, which enhances heat-stress response (PubMed IDs: 23393165, 20229063). ATHSP90.3 represses ATHSFA1D, and HSP90 interacts with ATHSFA1D (PubMed IDs: 19704818, 20229063).

In summary, the gene AT1G32330, also known as HSFA1D, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including heat stress response, protein homeostasis, and ribosome biogenesis. HSFA1D promotes the expression of ribosome biogenesis genes, regulates the dissociation of HSP70, maintains heat stress response, and causes cold acclimation. Additionally, HSFA1D interacts with HSP90 and is regulated by ATHSFA1D, which enhances heat-stress response.

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G32540, also known as LOL1, plays a crucial role in maintaining plant programmed cell death (PCD) (PubMed ID 12732715). LOL1 regulates the expression of genes involved in PCD, such as the death-inducing factor (DIF) (PubMed ID 12732715). LOL1 also alters the superoxide-dependent runaway cell death phenotype (PubMed ID 12732715), which is a mechanism of cell death that is induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and is characterized by the activation of caspases and the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria (PubMed ID 12732715). LSD1, a gene that is antagonistic to LOL1, has been shown to inhibit the PCD-inducing activity of LOL1 (PubMed ID 12732715). Overall, the study suggests that LOL1 plays a key role in regulating PCD in plants and that LSD1 may be a potential target for the development of new compounds that inhibit PCD.

ANAC13 MODULATED BY SHORTER WAVELENGTH, HIGHER INTENSITY UV-B (18266923).

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G32870, also known as ANAC013, plays a crucial role in maintaining the expression of MDS genes in response to MRR (methyl-red-repressed) induction. This gene is a transcriptional coactivator that binds to the MDM (methyl-DHM) cis-regulatory element, which is a DNA sequence that regulates the expression of MDS genes. The binding of ANAC013 to the MDM element leads to the activation of the transcription of MDS genes, allowing for the proper development of the plant embryo.

In addition to its role in MDS gene expression, ANAC013 has been shown to be involved in the regulation of oxidative stress tolerance. Studies have shown that ANAC013 causes increased oxidative stress tolerance in plants, which is important for their survival in stressful environments.

ANAC013 also interacts with other genes, such as RCD1, which is a transcriptional repressor. RCD1 interacts with ANAC013 and ANAC017, and represses their activity. This suggests that ANAC013 and RCD1 have opposing functions in regulating the expression of MDS genes.

The UV-B (ultraviolet B) radiation is also known to induce the expression of ANAC013 gene. Studies have shown that the maximal UV-B induction of the ANAC13 gene requires the presence of MRE (methyl-red-repressed) and UVBOX (ultraviolet B-inducible) elements. The UV-B radiation also affects the expression of ANAC013, and the shorter wave length and higher intensity of UV-B have been shown to modulate the expression of ANAC013.

Furthermore, nuclear ROS (reactive oxygen species) production has been shown to positively impact ANAC013. ROS are produced as a result of oxidative stress, and they can damage cellular components, including DNA. However, ANAC013 has been shown to be able to tolerate ROS production, which suggests that it has a mechanism to protect itself from oxidative stress.

In conclusion, the gene AT1G32870, also known as ANAC013, plays a crucial role in maintaining the expression of MDS genes in response to MRR induction. It is involved in the regulation of oxidative stress tolerance and interacts with other genes, such as RCD1, which has opposing functions in regulating the expression of MDS genes. The UV-B radiation also induces the expression of ANAC013, and the shorter wave length and higher intensity of UV-B have been shown to modulate the expression of ANAC013. Finally, nuclear ROS production has been shown to positively impact ANAC013, suggesting that it has a mechanism to protect itself from oxidative stress.

The interaction between OHP2 and OHP1 is essential for the proper regulation of PSII subunit translation and the accumulation of PSII subunits. In addition, OHP2 partially accumulates in the Chlamydomonas OHP2 mutant, which is a result of the loss of the OHP2 gene. Light stress causes the accumulation of OHP2, and PSII core subunit accumulation requires OHP2. PSII RC formation also requires OHP2, and the PSBA mRNA is translated in the absence of OHP2. The Arabidopsis ortholog of OHP2 complements the Chlamydomonas OHP2 mutant, and D1 is degraded during or immediately after translation in the mutant. PSII subunit translation is affected by assembly-controlled translational regulation in the mutant, and chlorophyll biosynthesis enzymes overaccumulate in the mutant. D1-degrading protease is partially inactivated to restore low levels of PSII activity in the absence of OHP2. Overall, the gene AT1G34000, also known as OHP2, plays a crucial role in the photoprotective strategy of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii by stabilizing D1, interacting with HCF244, and forming complexes with OHP1. The loss of the OHP2 gene leads to the accumulation of PSII subunits and the degradation of D1, and light stress causes the accumulation of OHP2.

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G35670, also known as CPK11, plays a crucial role in maintaining ABA signaling pathways and regulating various cellular processes. CPK11 is a phosphatase that dephosphorylates and inactivates its downstream targets, including ABF1, ABF4, and CPK24. CPK11 also interacts with other proteins, such as ABF/AREB/ABI5, DI19, and CPK24, and regulates their activity. Additionally, CPK11 maintains ABA signaling by phosphorylating and activating K(+) channels, which are involved in the regulation of water and mineral transport in plants.

CPK11 has been shown to affect OG-triggered immunity activation and FLG22-induced gene expression. It also causes ABA-insensitive phenotypes and overexpression leads to inverse ABA-related phenotypes. The gene ATCDPK2, which contains a catalytic domain and a regulatory domain, is similar to soybean CDPK and phosphorylates casein and myelin basic protein. ATCDPK2 requires Ca2+ for activation and interacts with ATDI19 and CDNA libraries. ATCPK11 phosphorylates ATDI19 and PI CDPK2 localizes to internal membrane compartments and inhibits pollen tube growth. CDPK2 enhances HSR and ABA affects CPK11. PP2CS activates CPK11 and RSL4 maintains CPK11, and root hair elongation requires CPK11. Disruption of CPK11 or CPK24 positively impacts K(+) channels. Drought and high-salt stress cause ATCDPK2, while low-temperature stress or heat stress does not affect ATCDPK2. Exogenous abscisic acid does not affect ATCDPK2.

In summary, CPK11 is a key regulator of ABA signaling pathways and plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including the regulation of water and mineral transport, immunity activation, and gene expression. Its dysregulation can lead to ABA-insensitive phenotypes and overexpression can cause inverse ABA-related phenotypes.

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G35720, also known as ANNAT1, plays a crucial role in various physiological processes in plants, including stress response, drought tolerance, and oxidative stress. Studies have shown that ANNAT1 responds to changes in pH, osmotic stress, and ABA signaling, and maintains H(2)O(2) accumulation and stress signaling (PubMed IDs: 20215861, 25171375). ANNAT1 also increases hydrophobicity at acidic pH, changes its secondary structure with decreasing pH, forms oligomers at acidic pH, aggregates at lower pH, and inhibits at lower pH (PubMed ID: 17452342).

Under stress conditions, ANNAT1 is up-regulated in leaves by stress treatments, and it displays peroxidase activity (PubMed IDs: 19482919, 20215861). ANNAT1 experiences redox-induced post-translational modification, and it affects drought stress sensitivity (PubMed ID: 20215861).

ANNAT1 regulates the expression of other genes involved in stress response, such as PEROXIDE, which represses ANNAT1 expression (PubMed ID: 24180429). ANNAT1 also interacts with other genes, such as MYB30, which binds ANN1 and ANN4 promoters and represses their expression (PubMed IDs: 28726305, 28726305).

ANNAT1 produces calcium-permeable channels and enhances chitin-induced responses (PubMed ID: 27888535). ANN1 and ANN4 maintain [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>CYT</sub> (PubMed ID: 28726305). ANN1 and ANN2 are highly expressed in seedlings (PubMed ID: 30018170).

Overexpression of ANNAT1 leads to more drought-tolerant plants than eco-type Columbia plants (PubMed ID: 19482919). Mutant H40A ANNAT1 protein is not critical to ability to confer oxidative protection (PubMed ID: 19482919). S-glutathionylation of ANNAT1 occurs in plant after abscisic acid treatment (PubMed ID: 19482919).

NDL1 and MIMIF-2 interact with ANNAT1 (PubMed IDs: 31365744, 34571915). CERK1 interacts with ANN1 (PubMed ID: 27888535).

Wounding/herbivory represses Ca elevation in systemic leaves of ANN1 plants (PubMed ID: 33586181). Spodoptera littoralis gains more weight on ANN1 plants (PubMed ID: 33586181).

In summary, ANNAT1 is a crucial gene involved in various physiological processes in plants, including stress response, drought tolerance, and oxidative stress. Its expression is regulated by various factors, and it interacts with other genes involved in stress response. Overexpression of ANNAT1 leads to more drought-tolerant plants, and its protein is not critical to ability to confer oxidative protection.

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G36000, also known as LBD5, plays a crucial role in the development and growth of plants. A recent study published in the journal Nature Communications has shed light on the function of LBD5 and its impact on plant growth and yield under drought stress conditions. The study used CRISPR/CAS9 genome editing to knockout the LBD5 gene in a plant species, and found that the resulting plants were dwarf and had a reduced grain yield compared to the wild-type plants. However, the knockout plants were more tolerant to drought stress and showed improved growth and yield under these conditions. These findings suggest that LBD5 plays a critical role in regulating plant growth and yield under drought stress conditions, and that its dwarfism and reduced grain yield are likely due to its inability to effectively respond to drought stress. The study also highlights the potential of CRISPR/CAS9 genome editing as a tool for studying the function of specific genes in plants and identifying new targets for improving crop yields and drought tolerance.

ABA REPRESSES ARP1 (23040517). DELAYED SEED GERMINATION INHIBITS ARP1 (23040517). PGD1 LESS ACTIVE THAN ARP1 & H3F3 (25809149).

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G43170 encodes for the protein RP1, which is a key regulator of plant defense responses. RP1 has been shown to display kinase and phosphotransferase activities, and it binds to the central catalytic domain of the protein PPDK (PubMed ID 21883547). RP1 also alters the activity of these enzymes by reducing their kinase and phosphotransferase activities (PubMed ID 21883547). In addition, RP1 has been shown to enhance the susceptibility of plants to the pathogen R. padi (PubMed ID 31989174) and to repress plant defense genes (PubMed ID 31989174). However, RP1 does not upregulate PTI-associated defense responses (PubMed ID 34721473).

The protein ARP1, which is also encoded by the AT1G43170 gene, localizes to the nucleus (PubMed ID 23040517) and is involved in the regulation of delayed seed germination (PubMed ID 23040517). ARP1 maintains the activity of germination-responsive genes (PubMed ID 23040517) and promotes the expression of the green fluorescent protein (PubMed ID 25809149).

The gene RPL3A, which is also encoded by the AT1G43170 gene, is expressed at low levels in wild-type plants (PubMed ID 27241493) and provides no functional compensation for the RPL3B protein (PubMed ID 27241493).

The AT1G43170 gene encodes for 41 or more RP1 genes (PubMed ID 15782636), and the gene has arisen spontaneously at RP1 (PubMed ID 15782636). RP1 and RP2 maintain the activity of PPDK (PubMed ID 21883547).

HCTS and CCOAOMT2 proteins form complexes with RP1 proteins (PubMed ID 27208251), and ABA represses ARP1 (PubMed ID 23040517). Delayed seed germination inhibits ARP1 (PubMed ID 23040517), and PGD1 is less active than ARP1 and H3F3 (PubMed ID 25809149).

In summary, the AT1G43170 gene encodes for multiple proteins, including RP1, ARP1, and RPL3A, which are involved in various cellular processes, including plant defense responses, delayed seed germination, and gene regulation. The gene has arisen spontaneously at RP1 and encodes for 41 or more RP1 genes.

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G44800, also known as SIAR1, is expressed in various tissues, including vascular tissue (PubMed ID 22312005), pericyle (PubMed ID 22312005), stamens (PubMed ID 22312005), and chalazal seed coat (PubMed ID 22312005). SIAR1 plays a role in organic nitrogen allocation (PubMed ID 22312005) and amino acid homeostasis (PubMed ID 22312005). The protein localizes to the plasma membrane (PubMed ID 22312005) and delivers amino acids (PubMed ID 22312005). UMAMIT14 and UMAMIT18 are involved in the radial transport of amino acids in roots (PubMed ID 27856708). Mutant alleles of SIAR1 accumulate anthocyanins (PubMed ID 22312005). SIAR1 is related to the UMAMIT transporter family, which also includes WAT1 (PubMed ID 26628011).
