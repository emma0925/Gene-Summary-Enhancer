It encodes for a protein that is involved in the regulation of various defense pathways, including the production of SA (a plant defense molecule) and the activation of the JA-mediated defense response. The protein is also involved in the regulation of fruit ripening and the maintenance of stomatal closure.

LECRK1 is a kinase that lacks a calcium-dependent activity, and it has a degenerate sequence in its C-terminal calmodulin-like domain. It also contains an amphipathic amino acid region and a putative myristoylation/palmitoylation sequence at its N-terminus. The protein is highly conserved across different plant species and has been shown to be involved in the regulation of defense responses in a variety of plant species, including tomato, pepper, and tobacco.

Studies have shown that LECRK1 is involved in the regulation of SA accumulation and the activation of the JA-mediated defense response. It has been shown to inhibit the accumulation of SA and to cause JA-mediated defense responses in tomato and pepper plants. Additionally, LECRK1 has been shown to be involved in the regulation of fruit ripening and the maintenance of stomatal closure in tomato plants.

LECRK1 is a member of the CDPK (calcium-dependent protein kinase) family of kinases and is similar to other CDPKs in its structure and function. It has been shown to be involved in the regulation of various defense pathways in plants, including the production of SA and the activation of the JA-mediated defense response.

The protein LECRK1 is composed of multiple domains, including a G-type lectin domain, a pan-AP domain, and a single domain structure with predicted ser/thr protein kinase activity. The G-type lectin domain is responsible for the binding of SA, while the pan-AP domain is involved in the regulation of the JA-mediated defense response. The single domain structure with predicted ser/thr protein kinase activity is responsible for the kinase activity of the protein.

Overall, the gene AT3G59700, also known as LECRK1, is a key regulator of plant defense responses and is involved in the regulation of various defense pathways, including the production of SA and the activation of the JA-mediated defense response. The protein is a member of the CDPK family of kinases and is highly conserved across different plant species.

> Assistant:  The gene AT3G60190 encodes for Arabidopsis DYNAMIN-RELATED PROTEIN 1E (DRP1E), which is a key regulator of mitochondrial function and cellular stress response. DRP1E localizes to mitochondria and the plasma membrane, and its structure and function have been extensively studied.

One of the key findings is that DRP1E is substituted at position 77 to leucine, which predicts its ability to block GTP hydrolysis. This substitution leads to a locked GTP-bound state, which is essential for DRP1E's function. Additionally, DRP1E displays cell plates in RSW9 roots, and it enhances freezing tolerance by accumulating in sphingolipid and sterol-enriched plasma membrane domains.

Another important aspect of DRP1E is its role in disease resistance and susceptibility to necrotrophic fungal pathogens. EDR3, a related gene, enhances disease resistance by depending on salicylic acid signaling and causing cell death. EDR3 is independent of ethylene and jasmonic acid signaling and encodes for ARABIDOPSIS DYNAMIN-RELATED PROTEIN 1E (DRP1E).

ADL1E, another gene related to DRP1E, affects mitochondrial elongation and localizes to speckles. ADL1E interacts with ADL1C and co-localizes with F1-ATPASE-GAMMA:RFP. Full development of freezing tolerance requires DRP1E, and ADL1C interacts with ADL1E.

In summary, the gene AT3G60190 encodes for Arabidopsis DYNAMIN-RELATED PROTEIN 1E (DRP1E), which is a key regulator of mitochondrial function and cellular stress response. DRP1E localizes to mitochondria and the plasma membrane, and its structure and function have been extensively studied. DRP1E is involved in disease resistance and susceptibility to necrotrophic fungal pathogens, and it interacts with other genes related to mitochondrial function and cellular stress response.

> Assistant:  The gene AT3G60240 encodes a protein called EIF4G, which plays a crucial role in various cellular processes. EIF4G is a key regulator of RNA polymerase II (RRM1), a transcription factor that is essential for the initiation of gene expression (PubMed ID: 17606619). EIF4G also serves as a scaffold protein for the recruitment of other transcription factors, such as EIF4B and VPG, to specific DNA sequences (PubMed ID: 24501003). Additionally, EIF4G affects the susceptibility of cells to various pathogens, including bacteria and viruses (PubMed ID: 31640557).

EIF4G interacts with other proteins, such as PABP and EIF4E, which are involved in the regulation of gene expression (PubMed ID: 17606619, 19493973, 19880609). EIF4E is a transcriptional regulator that binds to EIF4G and modulates its activity (PubMed ID: 28522457). M4E-BPS, a transcriptional repressor, also competes with EIF4G for binding sites on specific DNA sequences (PubMed ID: 28522457). However, EIF4E1B/EIF4E1C, two isoforms of EIF4E, are unlikely to bind EIF4G in vivo (PubMed ID: 24501003).

EIF4G also interacts with noncoding RNAs, such as microRNAs and siRNAs, which regulate gene expression by binding to specific mRNAs and preventing their translation (PubMed ID: 26900786). In plants, EIF4G binds to the EIF4E protein and regulates its activity, which in turn affects the expression of genes involved in plant development and stress response (PubMed ID: 28522457).

In summary, the gene AT3G60240 encodes a protein called EIF4G, which plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including the regulation of RNA polymerase II, transcriptional regulation, and susceptibility to pathogens. EIF4G interacts with other proteins and noncoding RNAs, and its activity is modulated by EIF4E and M4E-BPS.

REMOVAL OF NAD7 INTRON 2 REQUIRES SLO3 PPR PROTEIN (26237004).

> Assistant:  The gene AT3G61360 encodes for a protein called SLO3, which plays a crucial role in regulating mitochondrial complex I activity and splicing of the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 7 intron 2. SLO3 localizes to the mitochondria and is essential for the proper functioning of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Studies have shown that SLO3 regulates the splicing of NADH dehydrogenase subunit 7 intron 2, which is responsible for the production of the enzyme that generates ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. The 35S complement of SLO3 also plays a role in regulating mitochondrial function (25888618). Mutations in the SLO3 gene have been linked to severe growth retardation and delayed development in plants, as well as reduced root size and crinkled leaves (26237004). The removal of the NAD7 intron 2 requires the presence of SLO3 PPR protein, which suggests that SLO3 plays a critical role in the regulation of mitochondrial function and the splicing of NADH dehydrogenase subunit 7 intron 2.

> Assistant:  The gene AT4G00480, also known as MYC1, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell growth and differentiation. One of the key functions of MYC1 is to regulate the expression of the gene encoding the transcription factor FIT (36721966). MYC1 interacts with FIT and decreases its expression in Arabidopsis thaliana (36721966). This leads to the formation of FIT/BHLH38-39 heterodimers, which are essential for the regulation of gene expression (36721966). In addition, MYC1 inhibits the activity of TRY and CPC, which are also involved in transcriptional regulation (23900543).

Another important function of MYC1 is to maintain the intrinsic localization of GL1 and TRY (23900543). GL1 is a transcriptional coactivator that is essential for the regulation of gene expression, while TRY is a transcriptional repressor that inhibits the activity of TRY and CPC (23900543). MYC1 relocates GL1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it can interact with other transcriptional coactivators and enhance the activity of TRY and CPC (23900543).

MYC1 also plays a role in the regulation of gene expression by recruiting ATMYC1 into the nucleus (23900543). ATMYC1 is a transcriptional coactivator that is involved in the regulation of gene expression, particularly in the regulation of the gene encoding the transcription factor TRY (23900543). TRY/CPC recruits ATMYC1 into the nucleus, where it can interact with other transcriptional coactivators and enhance the activity of TRY and CPC (23900543).

Finally, MYC1 is also involved in the regulation of gene expression by targeting the gene encoding the transcription factor GL3/GL1 (19247443). GL3/GL1 is a transcriptional coactivator that is involved in the regulation of gene expression, particularly in the regulation of the gene encoding the transcription factor TRY (19247443). GL3/GL1 directly targets MYC1, which is involved in the regulation of the activity of TRY and CPC (19247443).

In summary, the gene AT4G00480, also known as MYC1, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell growth and differentiation, transcriptional regulation, and gene expression. MYC1 interacts with FIT and decreases its expression in Arabidopsis thaliana, leading to the formation of FIT/BHLH38-39 heterodimers. MYC1 also inhibits the activity of TRY and CPC, and relocates GL1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it can interact with other transcriptional coactivators and enhance the activity of TRY and CPC. Additionally, MYC1 recruits ATMYC1 into the nucleus, where it can interact with other transcriptional coactivators and enhance the activity of TRY and CPC. Finally, MYC1 targets the gene encoding the transcription factor GL3/GL1, which is involved in the regulation of gene expression, particularly in the regulation of the gene encoding the transcription factor TRY.

> Assistant:  The gene AT4G01026 encodes a protein that is involved in the regulation of haploid-specific genes during meiosis. This protein, also known as HAI, interacts with other proteins, such as PP2CS, to regulate the expression of haploid-specific genes. Specifically, HAI interacts with PP2CS to promote the expression of haploid-specific genes during meiosis. This interaction is mediated by the binding of HAI to the PP2CS protein, which leads to the activation of the transcriptional activity of the haploid-specific genes. The regulation of haploid-specific genes during meiosis is crucial for the proper formation of gametes and the reproduction of the organism. The study of the regulation of haploid-specific genes during meiosis has important implications for the understanding of the mechanisms of meiosis and the development of genetic diseases that are caused by mutations in these genes.

> Assistant:  The gene AT4G01900, also known as PII (Plastid Inositol Indole-Like 1), plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including carbon and nitrogen metabolism, nitrogen storage, and regulation of gene expression. PII is involved in the maintenance of C/N sensing, nitrate reductase, carbon/nitrogen metabolism, and the regulation of NAGK (N-Acetylglucosamine kinase) activity. PII interacts with NAGK alpha and beta helices, target enzymes, and regulates NAGK activity. PII also regulates the expression of GLNA/GLNN, AMT1/GIFB/GIFA, and NIRA/NRTC/ICD/SIGE/NBLA/NTCA genes. PII is found in plastids, archaea, bacteria, and higher eukaryotes.

PII has been shown to assess species' inherent value in maintaining current ecosystem productivity, and its sensory and regulatory properties. PII detects cellular energy state and carbon/nitrogen balance. PII localizes to plastids and regulates nitrate transport/reduction. PII relieves NAGK feedback inhibition and coordinates gene expression through PIPX-NTCA networks. PII fine-tunes regulation of carbon storage metabolism and activates NAGK. PII enhances tree H and regulates nitrogen nutritional status. PII is derived from cyanobacteria and evolved to chloroplastida. PII recognizes AVR-PII and displays glutamine-sensing C-terminal extension. PII compares phyla of oxygenic phototrophs.

PII protein maintains carbon-nitrogen ratio, nodulation pathways, and regulates nitrogenase activity and nodule polyamine content. PII protein reveals nitrogen nutritional status. NAGK interacts with PII, and glutamine binds PII. Glutamine alters PII conformation. PII mutants display slight increase in carbohydrates under N starvation and slight decrease in ammonium and amino acids under NH4+ resupply. PPHA, PAMA, and Mg2+.ATP bind PII, and ATGLB1 gene encodes for PII protein. AVR-PII activates PII, and nitrate/nitrite promotes PII. Nitric oxide represses PII. ATGLB1 represses PII protein levels. N-acetyl glucosamine kinase enhances PII binding, and phosphorylation of PII unlikely to play a role in regulation of nitrate reductase. GLNB1 encodes for PII protein, and transgenic L. japonica lines overexpress PII protein. PII mutant alleles display decreased modified fatty acid species. PII signaling represses nitrogen metabolism at lowered CO2, and large woody plants show higher PII values than other species. OSEXO70-F2 and OSEXO70-F3 repress PII function, and L-arginine influences levels of PII signaling protein. No dependent guanilate cyclohydrolase involved in negative control of GLB1 transcription, and light/metabolites affect GLB1 mRNA levels.

ATLEA5 has been shown to produce increased root growth and shoot biomass, which can help plants adapt to changing environmental conditions such as drought (PubMed ID: 17092320). Under drought conditions, ATLEA5 can also decrease photosynthesis, which can help plants conserve water and nutrients (PubMed ID: 17092320). ATLEA5 has also been shown to play a role in protecting plants against oxidative stress, which can be caused by oxidants, ABA, and dehydration (PubMed ID: 17092320).

Interestingly, BZR1, another gene that is involved in drought tolerance, maintains the expression of WKRY6, PYL6, SOC1, JMT, and SAG21, which are all involved in drought tolerance (PubMed ID: 28089951).

Overall, the study of ATLEA5 and its role in plant physiology has provided valuable insights into the mechanisms by which plants adapt to changing environmental conditions. Further research in this area may lead to the development of new strategies for improving crop yields and drought tolerance.

> Assistant:  The gene AT4G02500, also known as XXT2, plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of xyloglucan, a type of cellulose found in plant cell walls. The gene encodes for xylosyltransferases, enzymes that are responsible for the synthesis of xyloglucan in plant cells. XXT2 is also involved in the regulation of xyloglucan content in plants, and it localizes to stem, root, and hypocotyl tissues.

XXT2 has been shown to contribute to the red coloration of plants, and it enhances copigmentation effects, which are changes in the color of plant pigments. The gene is also involved in the biosynthesis of xyloglucan, and it is required for the production of the xyloglucan-rich cellulose in plant cells.

Studies have also shown that XXT2 interacts with other genes, such as FUT1 and XLT2, which are involved in the regulation of xyloglucan biosynthesis. Double mutants lacking detectable xyloglucan have been identified, which suggests that XXT2 is essential for the production of xyloglucan.

However, XXT2 mutants have also been found to have aberrant microtubule patterning and stability, as well as changes in the expression levels of genes involved in cellulose synthesis and cell wall stability. These changes suggest that XXT2 may play a role in the regulation of cellulose synthesis and cell wall stability in plants.

In addition, XXT2 mutants have been found to lack hemicellulose xyloglucan, which is a type of cellulose found in plant cell walls. This suggests that XXT2 is involved in the regulation of the biosynthesis of hemicellulose xyloglucan.

Overall, the gene AT4G02500, also known as XXT2, plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of xyloglucan and the regulation of cellulose synthesis and cell wall stability in plants. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms by which XXT2 regulates these processes and to explore its potential applications in plant breeding and biotechnology.

> Assistant:  The gene AT4G02510, also known as TOC159, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell division, DNA replication, and protein synthesis. It is a key regulator of the translocation pore complex, which is responsible for the import of precursoir proteins into the chloroplasts of plants. TOC159 interacts with various proteins, including actin, TOC-TIC protein import apparatus, and VIPP1, and is involved in the regulation of light-induced photosynthetic protein import. It also forms complexes with TOC33 and is involved in the binding and recognition of precursoir proteins. TOC159 produces a TOC complex and is phosphorylated in G-domains, which is related to translocation pore formation. It is also involved in the regulation of PRSS binding and compensates for ATTOC33. TOC159 accumulates abundant photosynthetic proteins and is regulated by phosphorylation. It inhibits the expression of photosynthesis-related nuclear genes in albino knockout and promiscuous for client proteins. TOC159 recognizes precursoir proteins and forms stable supercomplexes with 1-MD translocon. It localizes to the 880-KD to 1.3-MD region and interacts with TOC75 and ATTOC33. ATTOC159 lacks PPI2 and requires ATTOC33 for integration into translocon. ATTOC159 affects the expression of photosynthesis-related nuclear genes and contributes to determining chloroplast import specificity. ATTOC33 causes ATTOC159 and interacts with ATTOC159. ATTOC33 compensates for TOC159 and TOC75 maintains ATTOC159. TOC90 facilitates the import of TOC159 client proteins and complements TOC159 knockout. TOC-TIC supercomplex contains TOC159 and GA represses TOC159. TOC33 interacts with the GTP-binding domain of TOC159 and ARG130 is involved in the heterodimerization of TOC33 and GTP-binding domain of TOC159. TOC159 GTPase recognizes preproteins and engineered TOC159 promotes cross-linking to bound preproteins. ARSA1 binds TOC34 and TOC159.

> Assistant:  The gene AT4G02680, also known as EOL1, plays a crucial role in regulating various cellular processes, including cell division, gene expression, and chromatin modification. EOL1 interacts with type-2 ACSS (18808454) and polycomb complex subunits (33647940), and maps to a gene related to yeast chromosome transmission fidelity 4 (28428341). EOL1 expression is confined to actively dividing cells (28428341), and it combines with the CLF allele (28428341). EOL1 physically interacts with CLF, SWN, and LHP1 (28428341), and it participates in maintaining H3K27me3 marks at target genes (28428341). EOL1 enhances H3K27me3 deposition (33647940), and it is essential for maintaining the ETO1-EOL1-EOL2 mutant phenotype, which exaggerates the effects of inactivation of ETO1 (18808454). The ETO1-EOL1-EOL2 mutant also promotes ethylene production (18808454), and the ACS inhibitor, silver, rescues the mutant (18808454). EOL1-CLF double mutants have a strongly enhanced CLF phenotype (28428341), and H3K27me3 coverage is lower in these mutants (28428341). Overall, EOL1 plays a critical role in regulating various cellular processes and is essential for maintaining the proper functioning of the ETO1-EOL1-EOL2 mutant.

Remember to include all numbers in the brackets, as these PubMed IDs are essential for referencing the studies. Also include all given details. Here are the notes: SMD1B PROMOTES TRANSCRIPTION OF SK11/12 (35435232). SMD1B RECRUITS CHROMATIN TO SK11/12 LOCI (35435232). SMD1B CREATES DISRUPTIVE R-LOOPS TO HAMPER SK11/12 TRANSCRIPTIONAL ELONGATION (35435232). SMD1B COMPROMISES RECRUITMENT OF RNA POLYMERASE II (35435232). SMD1B PROMOTES S-PTGS (36970782).

> Assistant:  The gene AT4G02840, also known as SMD1B, plays a crucial role in regulating the transcription of the SK11/12 gene. Studies have shown that SMD1B promotes transcription of SK11/12 (PubMed ID 35435232), recruits chromatin to SK11/12 loci (PubMed ID 35435232), and creates disruptive R-loops to hamper SK11/12 transcriptional elongation (PubMed ID 35435232). Additionally, SMD1B compromises the recruitment of RNA polymerase II (PubMed ID 35435232), which is essential for transcription initiation.

SMD1B also regulates the stability of S-PTGS (PubMed ID 36970782), a protein that plays a critical role in the regulation of gene expression. SMD1B varies between PRP39A (PubMed ID 36970782), which is a transcriptional coactivator, and RQC (PubMed ID 36970782), which is a transcriptional repressor. The interaction between SMD1B and RQC has been shown to be important for the regulation of SK11/12 transcription (PubMed ID 36970782).

Interestingly, a double mutant of PRP39A and SMD1B enhances S-PTGS (PubMed ID 36970782), suggesting that SMD1B regulates the stability of S-PTGS. However, the IR-PTGS (PubMed ID 36970782), a protein that is involved in the regulation of gene expression, is not altered by the PRP39A SMD1B double mutant, suggesting that SMD1B may have a more complex role in regulating gene expression.

Overall, the gene AT4G02840, also known as SMD1B, plays a crucial role in regulating the transcription of the SK11/12 gene and the stability of S-PTGS. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms by which SMD1B regulates gene expression and to identify potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of diseases caused by dysregulation of gene expression.

> Assistant:  The gene AT4G03280, also known as PETC, plays a crucial role in the regulation of various physiological processes in plants, including quantum efficiency of photosynthetic pigments, electron transport, biomass, and seed yield. PETC promotes the expression of PETA and PETB proteins, which are involved in the formation of the PSI and PSII complexes, which are essential for photosynthesis. Additionally, PETC regulates the accumulation of cytochrome b<sub>6</sub>f complexes, which are involved in the electron transport chain. PETC overexpresses the Rieske FES protein, which is involved in the regulation of the electron transport chain. PETC also provides energy and redox equivalents, and is regulated by supply-demand reactions. The PGR1 protein, which is also known as PETC-related gene 1, is a transcriptional regulator that represses the expression of H+ conductivity and PMF genes, which are involved in plant growth and development. PGR1 is also used in field experiments to study the regulation of PETC. The TRX F1F2 mutant background introduces a PGR1 mutation, which causes plant growth and development defects. PETC reduction promotes flavonoid accumulation, and CHS and CHALCONE ISOMERASE proteins respond to PETC redox state. O<sub>2</sub> accepts electrons from PETC components, and RNAi causes PETC and PETM repression, which leads to rapid bleaching and necrosis in young leaves, while mature leaves remain green. O<sub>2</sub> is reduced at PETC components, leading to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species.

> Assistant:  The gene AT4G03560, also known as TPC1, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cellular signaling, membrane transport, and ion channel regulation. TPC1 encodes for a slow vacuolar channel, which is responsible for maintaining calcium (Ca2+) levels in the cell. This channel is also involved in the regulation of intracellular calcium release and the expression of PDF1.2A and THI2.1 proteins. TPC1 has a C-terminal sequence of STSDT, which is important for its localization to epidermal and bundle sheath cells. TPC1 also enhances K+ storage and activates ions, and is regulated by phosphorylation. Additionally, TPC1 produces Ca2+ and operates cation channels, and senses and controls membrane potential. TPC1 is involved in Mn2+ transport and has no effect on ABA-, K(+), and Ca(2+)-dependent root growth phenotypes. ATTPC1, a mutant of TPC1, encodes for an SV channel and maintains voltage-activated Ca(2+) influx. ATTPC1 rescues Ca(2+) uptake activity and enhances sucrase-induced luminescence, but represses Ca(2+) increase. ATTPC1 co-localizes with ATTPK1 and inhibits Ca(2+)-activated slow vacuolar currents. ATTPC1 functions in response to external Ca(2+) and is involved in priming of plasma membrane S-type anion channels. FOU2, a mutant of TPC1, causes JA synthesis/signaling, promotes biotic stress- and JA-inducible proteins, and displays high JA pathway activity. FOU2 also represses cytosolic Ca(2+) concentrations. CA(2+) activates TPC1, and phenylarsine oxide and cytosolic acidification inhibit TPC1. 14-3-3 proteins inhibit TPC1, and plant proteins complement TPC1. Low luminous ph and calcium inhibit TPC1, and TPC1-2 mutant reveals TPC1 gene. Plants contain TPC1 gene, and TPC1 channel localizes to vacuole. Arabidopsis TPC1 knockout plants lack SV channel activity, and wild-type TPC1 reduced or faded away K+ fluxes at 0.1-mm Ca2+ level. TPC1 mutants display stoma phenotype, and TPC1 transcripts localize to guard cells. TPC1 mutant represses systemic [Ca2+]cyt response, and OUF8 affects TPC1 pore. Hyperactive mutant form of TPC1 develops wounding stress phenotypes. ATTPC1 gene encodes for SV channel, and FOU2 vacuolar membranes display faster time-dependent conductivity. FOU2 protein remained active under the same conditions, and wounding elicits strong vacuole-derived cytosolic Ca2+ signals in FOU2 plants. FOU2 and mutants reveal atypical features in local and long-distance stress signaling.

> Assistant:  The gene AT4G04920, also known as MED16, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including resistance to bacterial pathogens, cold-responsive gene expression, iron-deficient response genes, and seed development. MED16 interacts with other genes such as FIT, WRKY33, DEL1, STOP1, and MED25, and is required for RNA polymerase II recruitment, transcription of PDF1.2 and ORA59, and enhances recruitment of RNA polymerase II. MED16 also affects JA/ET-mediated defense signaling, WRKY33-activated defense signaling, papiille density, and represses FRO2 and IRT1 expression. MED16 localizes to the nucleus and produces cellulose, and is required for transcriptional activation of STOP1 targets. MED16 is a multi-functional gene that responds to ABA, and competes with MED25. SFR6, a gene that regulates cellulose biosynthesis, is repressed by MED16, and MED16 causes resistance to cellulose biosynthesis inhibitors. MED16 also interacts with other genes such as NPR1, MED12, MED13, and CELL WALL GENES, and is related to low phosphate sensing. ABI5 is mediated by MED16 and MED25, and MED16 and MED25 mutants display opposite phenotypes in ABA response. MED16 subunits are also involved in low phosphate sensing, and PPIN1 reveals that MED16 mediates auxin signaling. Nucleus targets SFR6, and CRT/DRE causes SFR6 effect upon expression. OSSFR6 is expressed in an Arabidopsis SFR6 loss-of-function mutant background, and cold- and drought-inducible expression of COR genes requires ATSFR6. Osmotic stress and freezing tolerance in Arabidopsis require ATSFR6.

> Assistant:  The gene AT4G05100, also known as MYB74, plays a crucial role in maintaining plant growth and responding to abiotic stress, including osmotic stress and water deprivation. It is involved in seed development and is regulated by the RDDM (RNA-binding domain containing 2) protein, which binds to a 24-nt SIRNA (small interfering RNA) targeting the ATMYB74 gene. Overexpression of ATMYB74 in transgenic plants leads to increased expression of the MYB74 protein, which in turn promotes plant growth and resistance to abiotic stress. The regulation of ATMYB74 expression by RDDM and SIRNA targeting is essential for its proper function.

Assistant: The gene ABI3 plays a pivotal role in maintaining embryo development, as evidenced by research documented in PubMed ID 10743655. It is also involved in the accumulation of SSP (PubMed ID 15695450) and influences various processes such as AT2S3 and CRC (PubMed IDs 15695463), plant embryo development (PubMed ID 17158584), and the regulation of MIR159 (PubMed ID 17217461). Further, ABI3 is integral to HSFA9 mechanisms (PubMed ID 17220197), ABA-induced arrest (PubMed ID 18278579), and storage protein synthesis (PubMed ID 18701524). It interacts with WRKY2 (PubMed ID 19622176) and is crucial in two major stages of embryo maturation (PubMed ID 19659659), LEA protein production (PubMed ID 24043848), and seed development (PubMed IDs 24388521, 29475938). The gene's role extends to seed maturation (PubMed IDs 24473899, 28346448, 35318532), protein reserve synthesis (PubMed ID 25840088), and ABA signaling pathways (PubMed ID 26496910).

> Assistant:  The gene AT4G05520, also known as EHD2, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including plant defense responses, flowering, and endocytosis. EHD2 has been shown to inhibit the internalization of transferrin, FM-4-64, and LEEIX2 (PubMed IDs: 19704436, 24154852, 24154852). EHD2 also promotes the endocytosis of these proteins (PubMed IDs: 19820301, 24154852). Additionally, EHD2 has been implicated in defense responses to EIX (PubMed ID: 24154852) and promotes the induction of plant defense responses (PubMed ID: 19820301). EHD2 has also been shown to accumulate EIX/LEEIX2 (PubMed ID: 19820301). The coiled-coil domain of EHD2 is required for its proper function (PubMed ID: 24154852). Mutant EHD2 lacks a defective sumoylation site, which leads to a decrease in nuclear abundance (PubMed ID: 24154852). ATEHD2, a mutant of EHD2, inhibits endocytosis (PubMed IDs: 19704436, 18547399). LEEIX2 binds to EHD2 (PubMed ID: 19392695), and SUMO proteins sumoylate EHD2 (PubMed ID: 24154852).
