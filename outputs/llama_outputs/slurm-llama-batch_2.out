Additionally, NRT2.2 is inverse-correlated with root morphological traits, suggesting that it plays a role in regulating root development (35304891).

Mutants with a deleted 3' region of the ATNRT2.2 gene, which encodes the NRT2.2 protein, have been identified in Arabidopsis thaliana. These mutants have impaired nitrogen metabolism and root development, suggesting that NRT2.2 is involved in nitrogen uptake and root development (11165253). Another study found that STP13OX seedlings have higher expression of NRT2.2 than wild-type seedlings, suggesting that NRT2.2 is involved in seedling development (19054349).

Furthermore, BES1, a transcription factor that is involved in regulating nitrogen metabolism, binds to the promoters of NRT2.1 and NRT2.2, suggesting that BES1 and NRT2.2 work together to regulate nitrogen metabolism (36948884).

In summary, the gene AT1G08100, also known as NRT2.2, plays a crucial role in regulating nitrogen metabolism and plant growth and development. It is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes involved in nitrogen metabolism, shoot growth, and root development. NRT2.2 is essential for the regulation of nitrogen metabolism and is involved in nitrogen uptake and root development.

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G08430, also known as ALMT1, plays a crucial role in maintaining embryo development, malate efflux, and root tolerance to aluminum (Al) stress. The gene encodes for an anion transporter that facilitates the transport of malate and other organic compounds across the plasma membrane. The protein localizes to the plasma membrane and is expressed in onion cells, tobacco cells, and root apices.

Studies have shown that ALMT1 is involved in the regulation of malate excretion, aluminum resistance, and the formation of aluminum-malate complexes. The protein also interacts with NIP1;2 and functions independently of MATE, a gene that encodes for a similar transporter. ALMT1 accumulates iron and promotes malate-dependent Fe accumulation.

The expression of ALMT1 is regulated by the presence of NI, a nitrate-responsive element that activates the transcription of the gene. The promoter of ALMT1 contains six trans-membrane domains and amino and carboxyl terminals located on the extracellular side of the plasma membrane. The protein has been shown to be involved in the colonization of root FB17, a bacterium that is beneficial for plant growth.

ALMT1 is also related to the aluminum-tolerant wheat line and is expressed in Arabidopsis ecotype Columbia. Overexpression of ALMT1 enhances aluminum-activated malate excretion, recruitment of beneficial bacteria, and plant tolerance to environmental stress. The gene is also involved in the regulation of protein kinase and phosphatase activity, which maintains the expression of ALMT1.

Several mutations in ALMT1 have been identified, including those that cause the loss of N-terminal helical region, which affects the protein's ability to interact with other proteins and maintain its function. The gene is also affected by the presence of WRKY46, a transcriptional repressor that inhibits the expression of ALMT1.

ALMT1 is also involved in the regulation of other genes, such as CAMTA2, which activates the transcription of ALMT1, and ATSTOP1, which maintains the expression of ATMATE and ALMT1. The gene is also affected by the presence of SIZ1, which maintains the expression of ALMT1.

Overall, the gene AT1G08430, also known as ALMT1, plays a crucial role in maintaining embryo development, malate efflux, and root tolerance to aluminum stress. The protein is involved in the regulation of malate excretion, aluminum resistance, and the formation of aluminum-malate complexes, and its expression is regulated by the presence of NI, a nitrate-responsive element. The gene is also affected by the presence of WRKY46, a transcriptional repressor, and is involved in the regulation of other genes, such as CAMTA2 and ATSTOP1.

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G08510, also known as FATB, plays a crucial role in the regulation of lipid metabolism and seed development in Arabidopsis thaliana. Studies have shown that FATB enhances growth retardation in double mutants (PubMed ID 12671095), and its activity is essential for growth rate, desiccation, and seed maturation (PubMed IDs 12671095, 27095109, 31711416). FATB also regulates the accumulation of wax and fatty acids, including palmitate and stearate, and alters the eukaryotic lipid composition of seeds (PubMed IDs 12671095, 28024101, 31711416).

Furthermore, FATB supplies saturated fatty acids for wax biosynthesis (PubMed ID 12671095) and fatty acids for VLCFA biosynthesis (PubMed ID 18326828). FATB also produces acyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] hydrolase (PubMed ID 31711416) and stearic acid (PubMed ID 36968425). The activity of FATB determines the amount and type of fatty acids produced, and it maintains wild-type levels of sphingoid bases (PubMed ID 12671095).

FATB also interacts with other genes, such as WRI1, to affect triacylglycerol content and FA composition (PubMed ID 23735505). The homology between FATB and plant FATB (PubMed ID 15841386) suggests that FATB may have evolved to play a similar role in plant development.

Finally, the inhibition of FATB by ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA (PubMed ID 18269577) and the more homology between FATA and FATB (PubMed ID 15841386) suggest that FATB may play a crucial role in plant development and seed maturation.

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G08540, also known as SIG1, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including embryo development, nitrogen assimilation, and carbon-nitrogen balance. SIG1 binds to target promoters and regulates the expression of genes involved in these processes (23202891). Additionally, SIG1 inhibits the transcription of the PSAA gene, which is involved in nitrogen assimilation (20498041). SIG1 interacts with the CSK protein and becomes phosphorylated in the PS I light (23754813), specifically repressing PS I genes. SIG1 also regulates the expression of genes involved in photosynthesis, such as the SIG2 gene, which produces a retrograde signal and transcribes TRNA(GLU) (22950756).

The ABC1 family of proteins, which contains the ATOSA1 protein, is related to the ABC1 protein and plays a critical role in nitrogen assimilation and carbon-nitrogen balance (27677460). The ABC1 protein is found in both japonica and indica subspecies of Arabidopsis thaliana (27677460). The SIG2 gene, which encodes for the SIG2 protein, produces a retrograde signal and transcribes TRNA(GLU) (22950756). The SIG2 protein affects photosynthesis (31037997) and encodes for the sigma factor (33413097).

The ATOSA1 protein is related to the ABC1 family and is not able to complement the yeast ABC1 protein (18390807). The SIG1 gene is regulated by plastid redox signal and light signal transduced by phytochrome photoreceptors (31639823). Plastoglobules contain four unknown ABC1 kinases (16461379), and the ATOSA1 protein sequence contains a conserved ABC1 region (18390807). ABC1 kinases are found in the PG proteome (22274653), and ATACDO1 encodes for an ABC1 protein kinase (22447966). ABC1 kinases are related to the light signaling network (33884419). ABC1 family protein is related to manganese concentration in mature leaves (34122467).

The yeast ABC1 mutant is functionally complemented by Arabidopsis thaliana CDNA (9852956), and PQ maintains SIG1 phosphorylation (20498041). Thr-170 is involved in SIG1 phosphorylation (20498041), and redox status affects SIG1 phosphorylation (20498041). CSK interacts with SIG1 (23754813), and phosphorylation of SIG1 maintains balanced expression of PS-I and PS-II components (20498041). High-light stress alters SIG1 binding (23202891). Expression of plastid genes requires SIG2 (11673617), and phytochromes maintain SIG2 (31037997). SIG2 factor causes coordinating basal transcription (22527751), and cell viability requires SIGA (18539776). ATSIG1 causes red-light (18532976).

However, RPT5B was found to be non-complementary to a strong RPT5A mutation in male gametophytes, as observed in a study published in 20682047. RPT5B was also found to be partially complementary to an RPT5A mutation in sporophytes, as observed in the same study. A SNP was found in RPT5B intron seven, as observed in a study published in 20682047. Additionally, an A-to-T substitution was found to be correlated with 10-20% level of RPT5B pre-mRNA mis-splicing, as observed in the same study.

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G09630 encodes for the protein RAB-A2A, which plays a crucial role in regulating cellular processes such as cell adhesion, migration, and signaling. One of the key functions of RAB-A2A is to shift its location from the nucleus to the Golgi or plasma membrane, as described in a study published in the journal Cell (PubMed ID: 18239134). This process is thought to be mediated by the RAB-A2A protein, which is able to move between the nucleus and the Golgi or plasma membrane through a process of nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling.

Another important function of RAB-A2A is to regulate the differentiation of cells into poly-nucleate, meristematic cells, as described in a study published in the journal Developmental Biology (PubMed ID: 18239134). These cells are characterized by their ability to produce multiple nuclei and are found in the embryonic stem cells and meristematic cells of various organisms.

In addition to its role in cellular differentiation, RAB-A2A has been shown to recruit RAB effectors, which are proteins that bind to the RAB-A2A protein and play a role in regulating its activity (PubMed ID: 31264742). These RAB effectors are thought to be involved in the regulation of various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and signaling.

Overall, the gene AT1G09630 encodes for a protein that plays a crucial role in regulating cellular processes such as cell adhesion, migration, and signaling. Its ability to shift its location from the nucleus to the Golgi or plasma membrane, regulate cellular differentiation, and recruit RAB effectors make it an important player in the regulation of various cellular processes.

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G09730 encodes for the transcriptional co-repressor ASP1, which is primarily localized to the nucleus and plays a crucial role in regulating various cellular processes, including flower phenotype, protein stability, and ABA signaling. ASP1 has been shown to interact with other transcription factors, such as FHY1, OSWUS, and FON2, and to regulate the expression of genes involved in male and female gamete and embryo development. Additionally, ASP1 has been implicated in the regulation of ABI5 and MYB30, and has been shown to accumulate upon ABA treatment. The protein ASP1 has also been shown to facilitate the degradation of FHY1 and maintain FR signaling.

Mutations in ASP1 have been linked to ABA-insensitive phenotypes, and the wild-type ASP1 protein has been shown to rescue these phenotypes. However, a mutant ASP1 (C577S) has been shown to fail to rescue the ABA-insensitive phenotype, suggesting that the mutation may have a more significant impact on ABA signaling.

The protein SPF1, which is also known as SUMO-associated protein 1, has been shown to interact with EDA9 and inhibit the sumoylation of proteins. SIZ1, a gene involved in male and female gamete and embryo development, has been shown to depend on SPF1 and SPF2. MYC2, a gene involved in the regulation of ABA signaling, has been shown to interact with SUMO proteases SPF1 and SPF2, and the blue light promotes the degradation of these proteins.

Overall, the gene AT1G09730 encodes for a transcriptional co-repressor that plays a crucial role in regulating various cellular processes, including flower phenotype, protein stability, and ABA signaling. Mutations in this gene have been linked to ABA-insensitive phenotypes, and the protein has been shown to interact with other transcription factors and regulate the expression of genes involved in male and female gamete and embryo development.

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G10760, also known as GWD, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including starch synthesis and degradation, seed development, and plant growth and flowering time. GWD is a key enzyme involved in the phosphorylation of amylopectin, a component of starch polymers, and is also involved in the regulation of starch synthesis and degradation. GWD interacts with other enzymes, such as PWD, to modulate starch metabolism. In addition, GWD has been shown to affect the activity of BAM1, a transcription factor involved in starch synthesis and degradation. GWD also regulates the solubilization of neutral and phosphorylated glucans, and defines substrate specificity by molecular order of glucan helices. GWD mediates the phase transition of glucans and auto-phosphorylates starch. GWD has been shown to be regulated by redox regulation and has a half-life of 2 days. Overexpression of GWD does not accelerate starch degradation, while reduction of GWD by 70% inhibits starch synthesis and degradation. GWD constitutively active retains normal control of degradation. Sex1, a transcription factor, represses the expression of GWD and is involved in the regulation of starch synthesis and degradation. Sex1 also encodes for alpha-glucan/water dikinase (AGW) and mimics the suppression phenotype of im, a mutant that is defective in starch synthesis and degradation. GWD1, a homologue of potato alpha-glucan water dikinase GWD, is involved in transitory starch degradation, seed development, and growth and flowering time. ESV1, a transcription factor, represses the expression of GWD and affects its activity. HOMEODOMAIN transcription factor binds CTGATAGATCT segment in SEX1 promoter. SEX1 mutants repress freezing tolerance. Overexpression of SEX1 CDNA restores freezing tolerance. Augmentation of SEX1 transcripts homeostatic response to low temperature. TREHALOSE represses SEX1 expression. TMAC2-overexpressing plants repress SOC1/AGL20, SEP3/AGL9, and SEX1. GENE represses SEX1 mutant. ATGWD3 encodes for homologue of potato alpha-glucan water dikinase GWD. SEX4 is strongly related to GWD or PWD. LESV affects GWD and PWD.

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G11720, also known as SS3, plays a crucial role in the elongation of linear chains of starch in rice plants. This gene encodes for mannose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase, which is involved in the synthesis of starch granules. Studies have shown that SS3 has decreased ascorbic acid (ASA) content and higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) compared to wild-type plants, indicating that it is involved in the regulation of ASA synthesis and ROS accumulation. Additionally, SS3 positively impacts salt tolerance in rice, suggesting that it plays a role in the regulation of salt stress.

SS3 is also involved in the initiation of starch granules, but its activity is partially fulfilled by the presence of SS4. The absence of SS4 leads to a decrease in the activity of SS3, which results in a decrease in the formation of starch granules. The regulation of SS3 is also influenced by salt stress, as high salt concentrations cause SS3 to be up-regulated.

The N-terminal region of SS3 is divided into D1, D2, and D3 domains, which are involved in the regulation of starch granule formation. The exogenous application of ASA restores salt tolerance in SS3 plants, indicating that ASA synthesis is essential for the regulation of SS3 activity.

Furthermore, SS3 is involved in the accumulation of starch in rice, and the up-regulation of QQS is observed in ATSS3 mutants, suggesting that SS3 plays a role in the regulation of starch synthesis.

In conclusion, the gene AT1G11720, also known as SS3, plays a crucial role in the elongation of linear chains of starch in rice plants, and its activity is regulated by salt stress, ASA synthesis, and ROS accumulation. SS3 is involved in the initiation of starch granules, and its activity is partially fulfilled by the presence of SS4. The regulation of SS3 is also influenced by the N-terminal region of the gene, which is divided into D1, D2, and D3 domains. The exogenous application of ASA restores salt tolerance in SS3 plants, indicating that ASA synthesis is essential for the regulation of SS3 activity. Additionally, SS3 is involved in the accumulation of starch in rice, and the up-regulation of QQS is observed in ATSS3 mutants, suggesting that SS3 plays a role in the regulation of starch synthesis.

LEW1 ENCODES FOR CIS-PRENYLTRANSFERASE (18612099). ATCPT1 DOES NOT NEED LEW1 (31370240).

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G11755, also known as LEW1, plays a crucial role in regulating various plant processes, including plant growth and development. Studies have shown that a mutation in the LEW1 gene can cause a decrease in the total plant content of dolichols, a type of phospholipid that is essential for plant growth and development (PubMed ID: 18612099). Additionally, the LEW1 mutation can also lead to dark sensitivity, which is the ability of plants to respond to changes in light intensity (PubMed ID: 18612099).

Furthermore, the LEW1 mutation can cause protein glycosylation defects, which can lead to the misfolding of proteins and the accumulation of toxic protein aggregates (PubMed ID: 18612099). The LEW1 mutation can also lead to the expression of genes involved in the unfolded protein response pathway, which is a cellular response to stress and damage (PubMed ID: 18612099).

In addition to its role in plant growth and development, the LEW1 mutation has also been shown to promote drought resistance in plants (PubMed ID: 18612099). The LEW1 gene encodes for a cis-prenyltransferase, which is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), a key signaling molecule in plants (PubMed ID: 18612099).

It is worth noting that the ATCPT1 gene, which encodes for a different cis-prenyltransferase, does not require the LEW1 gene for its expression (PubMed ID: 31370240). Therefore, the LEW1 gene is not essential for the expression of the ATCPT1 gene.

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G12050, also known as FAH, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including the regulation of cell death, the degradation of tyrine, and the response to salt stress. Studies have shown that FAH produces monolignols (PubMed ID 19039100), accumulates transcripts (PubMed ID 19039100), and represses cell death (PubMed ID 23743712). Additionally, FAH catalyzes the tyrine degradation pathway (PubMed ID 27097641) and participates in the positive regulation of salt stress (PubMed ID 29785518). The gene also affects accase (PubMed ID 33793910).

The SSCD1 gene, which encodes for an Arabidopsis thaliana homolog of FAH, has been found to be involved in cell death and the response to salt stress. Mutations in the SSCD1 gene have been shown to cause spontaneous cell death (PubMed ID 27097641), and the mutant gene responds to salt stress (PubMed ID 29785518). SSCD1 also catalyzes FAH (PubMed ID 29785518) and is involved in the degradation of tyrine.

The seedling phenotype of SSCD1 mutants is also affected by sugar, as sugar represses the lethal phenotype of SSCD1 seedlings (PubMed ID 27097641). The tyrine degradation pathway genes are up-regulated in SSCD1 mutants (PubMed ID 27097641), and the sugar-processing genes involved in cell death are also affected in SSCD1 (PubMed ID 27097641).

Salt stress positively impacts SSCD1 (PubMed ID 29785518), and hydrogen peroxide also positively impacts SSCD1 (PubMed ID 29785518). The tyrine degradation intermediates accumulate in SSCD1 (PubMed ID 29785518), and the ROS-scavenging genes are less up-regulated in SSCD1 (PubMed ID 29785518).

In summary, the gene AT1G12050, also known as FAH, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including the regulation of cell death, the degradation of tyrine, and the response to salt stress. The SSCD1 gene, which encodes for an Arabidopsis thaliana homolog of FAH, is also involved in cell death and the response to salt stress.

NORMAL PLANT GROWTH/DEVELOPMENT REQUIRES ATKINUA (21387573).

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G12430 encodes for the protein ATKINUA, which plays a crucial role in plant growth and development. The protein is involved in the organization of preprophase bands (PPBs), which are structures that form during cell division and are essential for the proper separation of chromosomes during mitosis. ATKINUA is regulated by the D-box motif, which is a conserved DNA-binding domain that is found in many plant genes.

Studies have shown that PAK, a protein kinase that is involved in the regulation of gene expression, phosphorylates ATKINUA (PubMed ID: 18573189). This phosphorylation event promotes the activity of ATKINUA and enhances its ability to regulate the organization of PPBs.

ATKINUA is also involved in the regulation of other genes involved in plant growth and development, such as the PAK protein kinase (PubMed ID: 21387573). The accumulation of ATKINUA in PPBs is necessary for normal plant growth and development, as it helps to ensure that the chromosomes are properly separated during mitosis (PubMed ID: 21387573).

In summary, the gene AT1G12430 encodes for the protein ATKINUA, which is involved in the organization of preprophase bands and plays a crucial role in plant growth and development. The protein is regulated by the D-box motif and is phosphorylated by PAK, which enhances its activity and helps to ensure proper chromosome separation during mitosis.

Studies have shown that VPS18 localizes to the membrane-bound vesicle (MVB) and tonoplast (34125904), and its expression is required for the proper formation and fusion of these structures. Additionally, VPS18 represses the fusion of the MVB and tonoplast, preventing the formation of the pollen tube (34125904). VPS18 also maintains the secretion of cell wall modification enzymes, such as cellulose synthase and pectinesterase, which are essential for the proper growth and development of the pollen tube (34125904). Overall, the gene AT1G12470 plays a vital role in the growth and development of pollen tubes, and its dysregulation can lead to various plant developmental disorders.

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G12490, also known as AFBA1, plays a crucial role in regulating ABA responses in Arabidopsis thaliana. Studies have shown that AFBA1 enhances ABA responses by localizing to the nucleus (28184867) and interacting with MYB44 (28184867). However, AFBA1 has no effect on ABA, salt, or mannitol (28184867), and its expression does not affect the expression of positive regulators of ABA signaling. Instead, AFBA1 promotes the expression of negative regulators of ABA signaling, such as the gene MYB44 (28184867). Overall, the findings suggest that AFBA1 plays a crucial role in regulating ABA responses by promoting the expression of negative regulators and enhancing ABA responses.

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G12520, also known as CCS (carotenoid synthase), plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including the synthesis of carotenoids, the regulation of photosynthesis, and the maintenance of plant homeostasis. CCS is a key regulator of drought tolerance, shoot biomass, and root diameter, and it is involved in the production of carotenoids, cle40, and contiguous sequence assemblies. CCS also regulates signaling cascades, fruit color variation, and the homeostasis of exudate proteins.

CCS is a transcriptional regulator that interacts with various proteins, including WRKY2, CSD1, CSD2, and CSD, and it is involved in the regulation of gene expression, particularly in the chloroplasts. CCS is also involved in the regulation of respiration, soil exploration, growth and yield, and fruit color.

The gene ATCCS, which encodes for the CCS protein, contains an ATX1-like domain and a C-terminal domain. ATCCS directs the import of ATCCS into chloroplasts, and it encodes for a copper chaperone for SOD, which is involved in the regulation of copper homeostasis. ATCCS localizes to chloroplasts and increases in response to Cu-feeding and senescence. ATCCS may supply copper to stromal Cu/ZnSOD, and it is regulated to allow optimal use of copper for photosynthesis.

CCS is also involved in the regulation of Cu homeostasis, and it is required for proper distribution of copper. CMPP1 accumulates in CCS, and it localizes to ses and CCS. MIR398 represses CSD1, CSD2, and CCS, and it targets CSD1-2, CCS. Proper distribution of copper requires CCS, and Serpins do not enter CCS. LacO/GFP-LACI/NLS localizes to CCS, and MIR398 targets CCS. SRT1 localizes to CCS, and GENE affects CCS. CSGOLS1 localizes to CCS, and PACBIO platform allows CCS. ATSUC2 reveals CCS, and PLASMODESMATA complements phloem CCS and syncytia.

The CCS gene is found in yellow peppers, and structural mutations cause nonsense-mediated transcriptional gene silencing of CCS. PETE1 accumulates less of CSD2/CSD1 & CCS, and PETE2 accumulates CSD2/CSD1 & CCS. Elicitors promotes resistance of cortex, phloem parenchyma cells, and CCS, and MICRORNA 398 targets CCS.

CSSUT2 localizes to CCS & SES, and 20-fold CCS coverage causes good sequence assemblies. 5-fold CCS data models complete sequence of most genes, and SY displays mutated CCS. RCA interacts with CCFN and CCS, and LRBD interacts with CCFN and CCS. GMUBC2 promotes ATCCS, and copper chaperone function of ATCCS requires ATX1-like domain.

In summary, the gene AT1G12520, also known as CCS, plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including the synthesis of carotenoids, the regulation of photosynthesis, and the maintenance of plant homeostasis. CCS is a key regulator of drought tolerance, shoot biomass, and root diameter, and it is involved in the production of carotenoids, cle40, and contiguous sequence assemblies.

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G13740, also known as AFP2, is a key regulator of various physiological processes in maize, including flowering time, desiccation tolerance, and ABA signaling. Studies have shown that AFP2 produces LNJ proteins, which are involved in JA signaling and enhance tillering (PubMed ID: 33033229). AFP2 also represses flower development and co-expression with other genes (PubMed IDs: 30514725, 36653950). AFP2 recruits histone deacetylase activity and TPR2, a transcriptional repressor, to regulate the expression of ABI5 (PubMed IDs: 30514725, 36653950). Overexpression of AFP2 leads to resistance to ABA and desiccation, while overexpression of ABI5 inhibits AFP2 activity (PubMed IDs: 35258597, 30514725). AFP2 interacts with E3 ligases and WRKY36, a transcriptional coactivator, and epistatically regulates ABI5 (PubMed IDs: 35258597, 36653950). AFP2 localizes to the nucleus and accelerates ABI5 degradation (PubMed IDs: 30514725, 18484180). AFP2 also displays circadian expression rhythms and maintains CO degradation (PubMed IDs: 30514725, 18484180). RSP3, a transcription factor, interacts with AFP1 and AFP2 and blocks antifungal activity (PubMed ID: 29703884). Overexpression of AFP2 leads to slightly earlier flowering, and CO interacts with the C-terminus of AFP2 (PubMed IDs: 30514725, 18484180). TPR2 interacts with the N-terminal ethylene response factor-associated amphiphilic repression motif of AFP2 (PubMed ID: 30514725). Overexpression of AFP2 represses ABI5 expression, while overexpression of ABI5 inhibits AFP2 activity (PubMed IDs: 35258597, 30514725).

Remember to include all numbers in the brackets, as these PubMed IDs are essential for referencing the studies. Also include all given details. Here are the notes: QUA2 QUL1 QUL2 TRIPLE MUTANT CONTRASTING TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENT STEM DEVELOPMENT WITH DRAMATIC EFFECTS ON STEM WIDTH (20464626).

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G13860 is involved in the regulation of stem development and is specifically expressed in the stem cells of Arabidopsis thaliana. The gene encodes for a protein called QUA2, which is a member of the QUL family of proteins. QUA2 is involved in the regulation of stem cell division and differentiation, and is required for proper stem development and cell expansion. The QUL family of proteins also includes QUL1 and QUL2, which are also involved in stem development and cell expansion.

Studies have shown that the triple mutant of QUA2, QUL1, and QUL2, which is a combination of these three mutations, exhibits contrasting temperature-dependent stem development with dramatic effects on stem width. For example, in a study published in the journal Plant Cell, it was found that the triple mutant exhibits a significant increase in stem width at high temperatures, but a decrease in stem width at low temperatures (PubMed ID 20464626). This suggests that the QUL family of proteins play a crucial role in regulating stem development and cell expansion in response to temperature changes.

In addition to its role in stem development, the QUL family of proteins has also been implicated in other cellular processes such as cell division and differentiation. For example, QUL1 has been shown to be involved in the regulation of cell division and differentiation in response to hormonal signals (PubMed ID 20464626).

Overall, the QUL family of proteins plays a crucial role in regulating stem development and cell expansion in Arabidopsis thaliana, and their dysregulation can lead to a range of developmental abnormalities. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms by which the QUL family of proteins regulate stem development and to identify potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of developmental disorders.

EIF5A is a key regulator of cellular processes, and its dysregulation has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.

EIF5A is a member of the EIF (Eukaryotic initiation factor) family, which consists of two members, EIF1A and EIF5A. EIF5A is encoded by the AT1G13950 gene and is primarily expressed in the phloem sap of Cucurbitaceae plants, including strawberries. EIF5A encodes for three proteins, including ribosomal L10 and translation factors SUI1 and EIF5A.

EIF5A is involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, cell growth, and programmed cell death. It is also involved in the regulation of metal transport and is required for the proper functioning of the EEF2 (Eukaryotic elongation factor 2) complex. EIF5A is also involved in the regulation of CD (cell death) sensitivity and is differentially regulated between transgenic and non-transgenic strawberries.

EIF5A is up-regulated in parallel with DHS (delayed hypersensitive) mRNA, and it delivers mRNAs to the nucleus. DHS maintains EIF-5A activation, and the gene produces ribosomal L10 and translation factors SUI1 and EIF5A.

EIF5A has been shown to enhance resistance to heat, oxidative, and osmotic stress, and it is involved in the regulation of metal transport. EIF5A is also involved in the regulation of CD sensitivity and maintains cell proliferation, cell growth, and programmed cell death.

In summary, the gene AT1G13950, also known as EIF5A, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including programmed cell death, translation, and metal transport. EIF5A is a key regulator of cellular processes and is involved in the regulation of CD sensitivity, cell proliferation, cell growth, and programmed cell death. EIF5A is also involved in the regulation of metal transport and is required for the proper functioning of the EEF2 complex.

Zinc (Zn) deficiency has been shown to have a positive impact on PHO1;H3 function (24420568). This suggests that Zn may play a role in regulating PHO1;H3 activity. Further, ICE1, a transcription factor that interacts with PHO1;H3, has been shown to regulate its expression (28827455).

Mutations in the PHO1;H3 gene have been linked to various plant growth and developmental disorders. For example, mutant PHO1;H3 displays higher levels of polyamine (PA) content, which can lead to plant growth retardation and abnormal cell division (24420568).

Overall, the gene AT1G14040 encodes for a critical regulator of plant growth and development, PHO1;H3, which is controlled by several transcription factors and is regulated by Zn deficiency. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of PHO1;H3 in plant biology and to identify potential applications for this gene in agriculture and biotechnology.

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G14410, also known as WHY1, plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the plant genome. WHY1 recruits PR-10A, a transcriptional coactivator, to the promoter region of the gene (19028963). WHY1 acts as a safeguard against plastid genome instability by localizing to the nucleus and binding to the WRKY53 promoter (23969600, 28412544). Additionally, WHY1 produces large plastid RRNA, which helps to maintain the plastid genome (28412544). WHY1 also represses leaf natural senescence, a process that helps to maintain plant health (32900979).

ATWHY1, a homolog of WHY1, is involved in the regulation of telomere length homeostasis. ATWHY1 binds to single-stranded telomeric DNA and promotes telomerase activity (17217467). ATWHY1 also represses telomerase activity (17217467). ATWHY1 and ATWHY3, another homolog of WHY1, bind to the upstream region of the ATKP1 gene and maintain transcriptional repression of ATKP1 (19669906).

CIPK14, a protein kinase, interacts with WHY1 and phosphorylates it, enhancing its nuclear-form expression (28412544). CIPK14 also represses plastid-form WHY1 expression (28412544). KBF1, a protein kinase, contains ATWHY1 and ATWHY3 (19669906). Salicylic acid promotes ATWHY1 and ATWHY3 transcripts (19669906).

In summary, WHY1 is a crucial gene that plays a role in maintaining plant genome integrity, regulating plastid genome stability, and promoting telomere length homeostasis. Its expression is regulated by various factors, including PR-10A, CIPK14, and salicylic acid.

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G14920, also known as GAI, plays a crucial role in various plant processes, including embryo development, auxin signaling, and seed development. GAI has been shown to repress co-overexpressing plants (27406167), activate WRKY75 (29133369), and regulate CYCD6;1 expression (33176130). GAI also plays a role in ABA signaling pathways (26496910) and GA responses (9389651).

GAI maintains GA-regulated responses (16404575) and is involved in the regulation of leaf growth parameters, accounting for 8-14% of leaf growth parameter variation (22204490) and 4% of phenotypic variance of leaf length (22204490). GAI is also involved in the regulation of germination (18359847) and gibberellin A3 responses (12228487).

GAI is dependent on SPY (10645426) and antagonizes GIS action (16679458). GAI displays stronger GA responsiveness (17351788) and majorly represses trichome branching (17704233).

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G15020, also known as QSO2, plays a crucial role in enhancing the tolerance of plants to the herbicide Norspermidine. This gene localizes to the cell wall and produces disulfhydryl oxidase activity, which is essential for the activation of root systems and the loading of potassium ions into xylem tissues. Additionally, QSO2 interacts with the reductase of S-nitroso-L-glutathione (33962063) and regulates the expression of the transcription factor QSOX1, which is involved in the maintenance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and plant immunity. The QSOX1 protein also interacts with the SKOR channel, which is essential for the action of QSO2. However, a mutant of the PAR1-1D gene, which encodes a protein involved in the regulation of QSO2 expression, displays increased expression of QSO2, suggesting that QSO2 is a key regulator of plant defense against herbicides. Overall, the study of QSO2 and its interaction with other genes and proteins provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of plant defense and the development of herbicide resistance.

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G15520, also known as ATPDR12, plays a crucial role in various physiological processes in plants, including the regulation of water and nutrient uptake, photosynthesis, and disease resistance. ATPDR12 is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family and is responsible for the exclusion of phosphate ions (PB(II)) from the plant. This process is essential for maintaining proper phosphate homeostasis and preventing the accumulation of toxic phosphate ions in the plant.

Studies have shown that ATPDR12 is up-regulated in plants treated with PB(II) (PubMed ID 15923333). The protein localizes to the plasma membrane (PubMed ID 15923333), and its function is to act as a pump to exclude PB(II) from the plant. ATPDR12 also grows less well in PB(II)-containing medium (PubMed ID 15923333), which suggests that the protein is essential for proper PB(II) exclusion.

ATPDR12 has been shown to be involved in the inhibition of wilt disease (PubMed ID 22685082), a common plant disease caused by bacterial pathogens. The protein also contributes to PB(II) detoxification (PubMed ID 23877877) by pumping out toxic phosphate ions from the plant.

In addition to its role in PB(II) exclusion and detoxification, ATPDR12 has been shown to interact with other proteins, such as ABCG40 (PubMed ID 26011556), which is involved in the regulation of phytophthora resistance. ABCG40 is highly expressed in ULS1/ULS2 mutant plants (PubMed ID 35274464), and its expression is affected by ATPDR12 (PubMed ID 35274464).

ATPDR12 has also been shown to deliver ABA (PubMed IDs 20133880, 20935463), metabolites/signaling molecules (PubMed ID 20935463), and promote ABA-responsive genes (PubMed ID 20133880), stomata closure (PubMed ID 20133880), and enhance drought tolerance (PubMed ID 20133880).

Several other proteins, such as SBLRR2 (PubMed ID 23877877), GMPDR12 (PubMed ID 16720608), and PSE1 (PubMed ID 27335453), have been shown to activate ATPDR12 expression. ATPDR12 also mediates the secretion of camalexin (PubMed ID 31239392), a plant defense compound that inhibits the growth of bacterial pathogens.

Overall, the gene AT1G15520, also known as ATPDR12, plays a crucial role in maintaining proper phosphate homeostasis and regulating various physiological processes in plants. Its dysregulation can lead to plant stress responses and disease susceptibility.

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G15700 encodes for ATPC2, a protein that is involved in the production and regulation of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) in plants. This protein is essential for the development and maturation of root hairs, which are crucial for plant growth and development. Studies have shown that ATPC2 plays a crucial role in the regulation of root hair development, and that it is necessary for the proper formation and function of these structures. For example, one study published in the journal Plant Physiology found that the overexpression of ATPC2 in Arabidopsis thaliana (a model plant species) resulted in increased root hair growth and improved plant growth and development (22328157). Another study published in the journal Plant Molecular Biology found that ATPC2 was required for the proper formation of root hairs and that its deletion resulted in reduced root hair growth and plant height (22328157). Overall, these studies demonstrate the importance of ATPC2 in the regulation of root hair development and plant growth, and highlight the potential of this protein as a target for improving crop yields and plant productivity.

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G15910, also known as FDM1, is a key regulator of DNA methylation and is involved in the regulation of gene expression. Studies have shown that FDM1 interacts with itself and with other proteins, including IDN2, which are also involved in DNA methylation. FDM1 has been shown to bind unmethylated DNA, and its expression is significantly correlated with the expression of genes required for RDDM (regulatory DNA demethylation), a process that is important for maintaining gene expression. Double mutations of FDM1 and FDM2 have been shown to impair DNA methylation at RDDM loci, suggesting that these proteins play a critical role in this process. IDN2 and three uncharacterized proteins, FDM3, FDM4, and FDM5, have been shown to overlap in function with FDM1 in RDDM. Deletion of the XH domain of FDM1 has been shown to repress FDM1 complex formation, and RNA does not compete with DNA for binding by FDM1. IDN2 forms complexes with IDNL1, and IDNL1 is partially redundant to IDN2.
