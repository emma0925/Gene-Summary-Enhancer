SCPIP2-1 REPRESSES ATTRX5 GENE (34903178).

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G45145 encodes for thioredoxin H5, a protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including DNA repair, protein synthesis, and cell signaling. The ATTRX5 gene is highly induced in sensitive Arabidopsis plants, indicating its importance in plant development and response to environmental stimuli. The encoded protein requires two active-site cysteine residues for its proper function, which suggests that it is involved in the regulation of protein-protein interactions.

The ATTRX5 protein is also regulated by the ATNUDX6 gene, which enhances its expression. The KO-NUDX6 gene, on the other hand, represses ATTRX5 expression, suggesting that it plays a negative regulatory role in the gene's function. The LOV1 gene, which guards the TRX-H5 protein, also plays a crucial role in the regulation of ATTRX5 expression.

In addition, the ATTRX3 gene partially compensates for the loss of ATTRX5, suggesting that it is involved in the regulation of protein synthesis. The SCPIP2-1 gene, which represses the ATTRX5 gene, also plays a role in the regulation of protein synthesis.

Overall, the ATTRX5 gene encodes for a protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, and its regulation is influenced by multiple genes and factors. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying the regulation of ATTRX5 and its role in plant development and response to environmental stimuli.

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G45231 encodes for Arabidopsis thaliana triethylguanine synthase (TGS1), which is essential for the synthesis of triethylguanine (TEG) in Arabidopsis. The TGS1 gene is also expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where it is known as TGS1DELTA. The TGS1DELTA mutant of S. cerevisiae is severely compromised under chilling conditions, indicating that TGS1 is involved in chilling tolerance. The TGS1 gene is also required for the synthesis of TEG in Arabidopsis, which is important for the plant's survival under chilling conditions. The ARABIDOPSIS TGS1 RESCUES SACCHAROMYCES CEREVISIAE TGS1DELTA MUTANT (28495891) study demonstrates that the TGS1 gene from Arabidopsis rescues the TGS1DELTA mutant of S. cerevisiae, indicating that the two species share a common ancestor and that the TGS1 gene has evolved to perform similar functions in both species.

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G50420, also known as SCL3, plays a crucial role in maintaining the development and maturation of Arabidopsis thaliana. SCL3 is a transcriptional regulator that interacts with various proteins and pathways to control the expression of genes involved in various biological processes, including cell division, cell growth, and stress response.

One of the key functions of SCL3 is to maintain the balance between cell division and cell growth. SCL3 regulates the expression of genes involved in cell division, such as the DELLA protein, which is a key regulator of cell division. SCL3 also interacts with the IDDS (IDD-Della Complex) protein, which is involved in the regulation of cell division and cell growth. SCL3 inhibits the activity of the IDDS protein, which leads to the inhibition of cell division and the promotion of cell growth.

SCL3 is also involved in the regulation of stress response pathways. SCL3 interacts with the SEU (Stress-Effector Unresponsive) protein, which is a key regulator of stress response pathways. SEU promotes the expression of genes involved in stress response pathways, such as the SHR (Stress-Hormone Receptor) protein, the SCR (Stress-Cold-Resistant) protein, and the SCL3 protein itself. SEU also physically associates with these proteins and regulates their activity.

SCL3 is also involved in the regulation of gene expression in response to light. SCL3 is highly connected to photoperiod-sensitive DEGs (Differentially Expressed Genes), which are genes that are differentially expressed in response to changes in light. SCL3 regulates the expression of these genes by interacting with the GAF1 (Gene Activation Factor 1) protein, which enhances the repression activity of SCL3.

SCL3 is also involved in the regulation of gene expression in response to other signals, such as the MIG3 (Mig3) protein. MIG3 is a transcriptional activator that causes SCL3 to be expressed. MIG3 also interacts with SCL3 and regulates its activity.

In addition, SCL3 is involved in the regulation of gene expression in response to the presence of the PCGA2OX1 (Phenylalanine-Citrate-Glycine-Alanine-2-Oxidoreductase 2 Oxidoreductase 1) protein. PCGA2OX1 is a transcriptional activator that promotes the expression of genes involved in stress response pathways.

Overall, the gene AT1G50420, also known as SCL3, plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance between cell division and cell growth, and in regulating stress response pathways in Arabidopsis thaliana. Its interactions with various proteins and pathways make it a key regulator of gene expression in response to various signals, including light and other signals.

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G50460, also known as HKL1, plays a crucial role in regulating plant growth and development. Studies have shown that HKL1 represses plant growth by binding to and inhibiting the activity of glucose (GLC) (PubMed ID: 19706780). Additionally, HKL1 maintains cross-talk between GLC and other plant hormone response pathways (PubMed ID: 19706780). Overexpression of HKL1 has been shown to reduce seedling sensitivity to high GLC concentrations and promote auxin-induced lateral root formation (PubMed ID: 19706780). However, HKL1 lacks GLC phosphorylation activity (PubMed ID: 22366209). This suggests that HKL1 may not directly phosphorylate GLC, but rather regulates its activity through other mechanisms. HKL1 has also been shown to promote seedling tolerance to exogenous GLC (PubMed ID: 22366209), and produces bulbous root hairs with enlarged bases (PubMed ID: 22366209). Furthermore, HKL1 interacts with HXK1, a gene that is involved in the regulation of GLC signaling (PubMed ID: 22366209). Overall, the findings suggest that HKL1 plays a complex role in regulating plant growth and development, and its dysregulation may contribute to various plant diseases.

ARF2 NEGATIVELY MEDIATES PLT2 PROTEIN (28074634).

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G51190, also known as PLT2, plays a crucial role in plant development and cell division. Studies have shown that PLT2 is essential for maintaining the stem cell niche in GCN5 mutants, which results in a stem cell defect and a ram-defective phenotype (PubMed IDs: 19376933, 25522358). PLT2 is also down-regulated in ELP2 mutants, which leads to a reduction in cell division (PubMed ID: 25998905). Additionally, PLT2 promotes cell division and is necessary for maintaining the meristem patterning of root stem cells (PubMed IDs: 28074634, 29233938). PLT2 is not induced in PLT3, PLT5, and PLT7 triple mutants, which suggests that it is a critical component of the PLT2-PLT3-PLT5-PLT7 regulatory network (PubMed ID: 29078398). PLT2 also activates root primordia and partially rescues the short-root phenotype in PLT2 overexpression mutants (PubMed IDs: 29339500, 29233938). PLT1 and PLT2 are also essential for maintaining the meristem patterning of root stem cells, and GMPLT2 is similar to PLT2 (PubMed IDs: 19666737, 20798978, 21045165). ROP3 represses PLT2, and HPY2 acts downstream of PLT1 and PLT2 (PubMed IDs: 19666737, 21045165). TIC downregulates PLT1 and PLT2, and ARF2 negatively mediates PLT2 protein (PubMed IDs: 24277277, 28074634). Overall, the PLT2 gene is a critical regulator of plant development and cell division, and its dysregulation can lead to various developmental defects.

It is involved in the delivery of flavonoids, anthocyanins, and other secondary metabolites, as well as in the regulation of citrate efflux and the production of multidrug and toxin extrusion proteins. MATE also maintains auxin homeostasis and affects plant disease resistance, cell turgor, and overall plant development. The gene is also involved in the transport of phytohormones and the delivery of secondary metabolites, such as cucurbitacins. MATE proteins also affect tip growth processes, senescence, drug resistance, and xenobiotic tolerance. MATE transporters display citrate and recognize TRAESCS3A01G499300, a gene family that is involved in the transport of organic substrates and monovalent cations. MATE transporters are localized to guard cells and seedling roots and affect floral and growth phenotypes. MATE transporters maintain the exchange of organic substrates and monovalent cations and are energized by electrochemical gradients. MATE protein FFT localizes to guard cells and seedling roots and affects floral and growth phenotypes. MATE protein FFT is related to secondary transporter gene family and is found in six Rosaceae genomes. MATE gene family is clustered into eight main subfamilies. Population size affects MATE availability, and MATE availability decreases with decreasing population size. ALMT1 functions independently from MATE, and ethylene reveals MATE choice. Behavioral MATE choice facilitates fish radiations. MATE transporters involved in response to P/Fe starvation. SUCROSE positively impacts MATE transporters. Genotyping assays display ELS1-D is gain-of-function mutant of novel MATE transporter gene, ELS1. MATE family gene maintains citrate exudation. Rice MATE genes display type-I divergence, and Arabidopsis MATE genes display type-II divergence. Two MATE transporters are involved in bias transport, and MATE efflux family protein is related to %NDFA. Whole-genome duplication events might play a role in the expansion of MATE genes family.

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G51940, also known as LYK3, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including the regulation of gene expression, cell signaling, and defense against pathogens. LYK3 is a transcriptional regulator that phosphorylates and regulates the activity of the protein PUB1 (20971894, 26839127), which is involved in the regulation of nod factor-induced genes (17586690). LYK3 also interacts with other proteins, such as NORK (28267253), which phosphorylates LYK3 and regulates its activity.

LYK3 localizes to the cell periphery (21742993, 25351493), where it regulates the expression of genes involved in defense against pathogens. LYK3 has been shown to reveal phosphorylation targets with an acidic motif XXXSDXXX (28267253), which is important for its function as a transcriptional regulator.

LYK3 also plays a role in the formation of infection threads, which are structures that allow pathogens to enter and infect host cells (17586690). LYK3 maintains a subset of nod factor-induced genes, which are involved in the defense response to pathogens (17586690).

LYK3 is not essential for nodule inception, which is the process by which a pathogen infects a plant (17586690). LYK3 encodes for a high-stringency receptor, which is involved in the recognition of pathogens (21742993). LYK3 is stabilized by the protein SYMREM1 (29712849), which helps to maintain its activity.

ATLYK3, a variant of LYK3, has been shown to repress defense genes and nod factor responses (24639336). ATLYK3 enhances resistance to the pathogens Botrytis cinerea and Pectobacterium carotovorum (24639336), but requires the phytoalexin-deficient3 (24639336) to do so. ATLYK3 is also repressed by elicitors and fungal infection (24639336), and has a negative impact on resistance against these pathogens.

ATLYK3 has been shown to reduce physiological responses to abscisic acid (ABA) (24639336), which is a hormone that regulates plant growth and development. ATLYK3 has a negative impact on resistance against B. cinerea and P. carotovorum, and reduces the physiological responses to ABA.

ATLYK3 has been shown to have a negative impact on the cross-talk between signaling pathways (24639336). PUB1, which is phosphorylated by LYK3, overlaps with LYK3 expression (20971894), and interacts with LYK3 (26839127). PUB1 also represses LYK3 signaling pathway (20971894).

In conclusion, the gene AT1G51940, also known as LYK3, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including the regulation of gene expression, cell signaling, and defense against pathogens. LYK3 is a transcriptional regulator that phosphorylates and regulates the activity of the protein PUB1, and interacts with other proteins, such as NORK, which phosphorylates LYK3 and regulates its activity. LYK3 localizes to the cell periphery, where it regulates the expression of genes involved in defense against pathogens. ATLYK3, a variant of LYK3, has been shown to repress defense genes and nod factor responses, and has a negative impact on resistance against the pathogens Botrytis cinerea and Pectobacterium carotovorum.

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G52150 encodes for the transcription factor ICU4, which plays a crucial role in regulating various cellular processes, including leaf phyllotaxis and cell organization. ICU4 is also involved in the regulation of the ATHB15 gene, which encodes for a transcription factor that is essential for the maintenance of vascular development and secondary wall development in plants. The MIR166 microRNA represses the expression of ATHB15, ATHB-9/PHV, ATHB-14/PHB, and ATHB-15 genes, and also maintains the cleavage of the ATHB15 mRNA (15773855). The ATHB15 protein is also involved in the regulation of primary wall development in parenchyma pith cells (26043238). The CNA (Chromosome Number Analysis) alterations in CLV1 mutants (15705957) also promote organ formation. The MICRORNAS (MicroRNA) represses the expression of ICU4, and the ICU4-1/2 promotes the transcription of ICU4 mRNA levels (16617092). The MIR166A mutant represses the expression of ATHB15 transcript levels (15773855). Transgenic plants overexpress the MIR166-resistant ATHB15 protein (15773855). The wheat germ extracts degrade the ATHB15 mRNA (15773855). The MIR165 microRNA downregulates ATHB-9/PHV, ATHB-14/PHB, and ATHB-15 genes (19704656).

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G52240, also known as PIRF1, plays a crucial role in regulating plant growth and development. It interacts with phytochromes, which are light-sensing proteins that help regulate plant growth and development in response to light. PIRF1 localizes to the cytosol and binds phytochromes in darkness, where it regulates the activity of ROPGEF, a protein involved in root elongation. The PR form of phytochrome A enhances the activity of ROPGEF in PIRF1, while the PFR form of phytochrome A represses it. Mutants with overexpressed or mutated PIRF1 display longer root phenotypes in darkness, indicating that PIRF1 is essential for root elongation in response to light. Overexpression of PIRF1 also leads to retarded root elongation, suggesting that PIRF1 regulates root growth in a precise manner. These findings provide new insights into the regulation of plant growth and development and highlight the importance of PIRF1 in plant physiology.

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G52400 encodes for the protein BGLU18, which is a beta-glucosidase enzyme that is exclusively localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) bodies. BGLU18 is induced at wounding sites, and it degrades glycosylated proteins, including the glycosyltransferase ABA (PubMed IDs: 19847124, 19147648). BGLU18 is also involved in the regulation of ABA signaling, as it degrades inactive ABA and activates inactive ABA pools (PubMed ID: 16990135). The loss of ATBG1, the gene encoding BGLU18, leads to defective stomatal movement, early germination, abiotic stress-sensitive phenotypes, and lower ABA levels (PubMed ID: 16990135). Additionally, ectopic ATBG1 accumulates higher ABA levels and displays enhanced tolerance to abiotic stress (PubMed ID: 16990135). The knock-out mutant of ATBG1 does not induce ER bodies, indicating that BGLU18 is essential for ER body formation (PubMed ID: 19147648).

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G52760, also known as CSE (Caffeoyl-Shikimate-Ethyltransferase), plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including lignin biosynthesis, cellulose metabolism, and stress responses. CSE is expressed in Arabidopsis thaliana, barrel medics, poplars, and switchgrass, and its localization is primarily in the plasma membrane. CSE degrades caffeoyl shikimate, a key intermediate in lignin biosynthesis, and regulates lignin deposition, flux towards coniferyl and sinapyl alcohol, and cellulose content. CSE also promotes glucose release and enhances the relevance of edges in GCNS. CSE is found in Populus and is involved in monolignol biosynthesis. Lysopl2, a related gene, degrades lysopc and localizes to the plasma membrane, increasing tolerance to H(2)O(2) and CD. Lysopl2 interacts with ACBP2 and binds CD(II). CSE mutants deposit less lignin, accumulate caffeoyl shikimate, and convert more cellulose to glucose. Zn, H(2)O(2) causes Lysopl2, and AT1G52760 displays both acyltransferase and hydrolase activities. Starch metabolism enhances CSE, and PCD localizes to CSE. M. truncatula lacks CSE orthologs, as do B. distachyon and Z. maize. Zein-related genes are repressed in CSE cells, and starch-related genes are also repressed. Poptocse1/2 maintains CSE activity.

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G53000, also known as CKS, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including leaf growth and PSII efficiency, leaf senescence, and developmental and physiological processes. It is involved in maintaining heat tolerance, leaf growth, and stomatal aperture, as well as regulating stress-related proteins and transcripts. Additionally, CKS promotes chloroplast proteins, is involved in photomorphogenesis, and regulates cell-cycle progression. It also affects ultra-structures, heat tolerance, and stress responses, and is involved in plant responses to stress, development of various organs, and yield potential. CKS is also related to other CK-related parameters and enhances contents. It is transported more rapidly than inducing agents, accumulates in roots, alters tulin, and overlaps with quinone HIF pathway. The gene produces CKS, accumulates CKS, and is produced by IPT, and IAA feedback is regulated by CKS. IAA interacts with CKS, and CKX represses CKS, and CKX7 degrades CKS. Sugars combine with CKS, and CKRS delivers CKS, and isoprene enhances CKS. Ammonium nutrition alters CKS, and NO interacts with CKS, and TDZ affects CKS and IAA levels. CKS and IAA are related to flower induction, and auxin and CKS are involved in floral transition. Reduced R/FR ratio promotes IAA, gas, and CKS, and E2F, CKI, RB, CKS, and WEE are related to 8 groups of CDKS. DNA methylation, PAS, gas, and CKS predictive markers of plant florality capacity, and CKS gene occurs as single-copy gene. CKS mutation inhibits pollen tube elongation, and CK receptors maintains isopentenyladine- and trans-zeatin-type CKS. SLIPT3 enhances CKS accumulation, VCS accumulates CKS and sugars, and Arabidopsis thaliana root meristematic zone profiled for naturally occurring CKS. CK-responsive type-A response regulator genes indicate active CKS, and TZ-type CKS protects against photoperiod stress. MTABCG56 increases mRNA levels upon symbiotic bacteria, nod factor, and CKS, and CSA-IPT5 maintains synthesis of CKS. CKS signaling pathway is mediated by MYB TFS.

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G53310, also known as PPC1, plays a crucial role in regulating various physiological processes in plants, including photosynthesis, carbon fixation, and circadian rhythms. PPC1 lacks transcripts in the dark period, which is when plants are not actively photosynthesizing (PubMed ID: 32051209). During the light period, PPC1 activity is increased, and it regulates the closure of stomata, which allows for carbon dioxide fixation (PubMed ID: 32051209). PPC1 also regulates the accumulation of malate in the nocturnal period, which is important for the synthesis of ATP (PubMed ID: 32051209).

PPC1 represses the expression of genes involved in light-period stomatal closure, including guard cell signaling genes (PubMed ID: 32051209). PPC1 also produces PEPC (PubMed ID: 25588735), which is a protein that regulates the expression of genes involved in photosynthesis. PPC1 localizes to the roots and flowers, and it plays a role in the regulation of CO2 fixation (PubMed ID: 26959080).

PPC1 enhances the activity of the circadian oscillator genes, and it promotes the expression of P107 (PubMed ID: 19228119). P107 is a protein that regulates the expression of genes involved in photosynthesis and the synthesis of ATP. PPC1 also phosphorylates SER-11, which is a protein that regulates the activity of PEPC1 (PubMed ID: 19228119).

PPCK, another gene that is similar to PPC1, activates PEPC1 (PubMed ID: 17624549). PPCK also phosphorylates PEPC1 (PubMed ID: 17624549). ATPPCK1/2, a gene that is similar to PPC1, promotes the expression of ATPPC1 (PubMed ID: 19228119). The inhibition of PPC1 by RNA interference (RNAi) leads to a decrease in the expression of genes involved in photosynthesis (PubMed ID: 32051209).

L-malate and L-aspartate inhibit the activity of ATPPC1 (PubMed ID: 19228119), while glucose 6-phosphate activates ATPPC1 (PubMed ID: 19228119). P107 enhances the activity of PEPC1, and it regulates the expression of genes involved in photosynthesis (PubMed ID: 16169958). The gene that produces PEPC1 is located on chromosome 10 (PubMed ID: 32468353).

COS, a gene that is similar to PPC1, selects for COS-PEPC1 (PubMed ID: 17624549). HCO3(-), a compound that is important for the synthesis of ATP, promotes the expression of PEPC1 and the activity of PEPCASE (PubMed ID: 23465471).

In conclusion, the gene AT1G53310, also known as PPC1, plays a crucial role in regulating various physiological processes in plants, including photosynthesis, carbon fixation, and circadian rhythms. PPC1 lacks transcripts in the dark period, and it regulates the closure of stomata during the light period. PPC1 also regulates the accumulation of malate in the nocturnal period and enhances the activity of the circadian oscillator genes. PPC1 produces PEPC, which regulates the expression of genes involved in photosynthesis, and it localizes to the roots and flowers. PPC1 also regulates the expression of P107, which regulates the expression of genes involved in photosynthesis and the synthesis of ATP. The inhibition of PPC1 by RNAi leads to a decrease in the expression of genes involved in photosynthesis.

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G53500, also known as MUM4, is involved in the biosynthesis of UDP-L-rhamnose, a compound essential for seed coat development in plants. MUM4 encodes for a rhamnose synthase, which catalyzes the conversion of UDP-L-rhamnose to L-rhamnose. This enzyme is expressed in a wide variety of plant tissues, including the seed coat, and is up-regulated during seed maturation. MUM4 <0.3PRO> is a transcriptional regulator that is regulated by the same transcription factor cascade as endogenous MUM4. MUM4 <0.3PRO> directs reporter gene expression in seed coat cells of Arabidopsis and Camelina sativa, providing a new tool for seed coat biology research. GL2, a transcription factor, maintains MUM4 expression, while KNAT3 and KNAT7 promote MUM4 expression. MUM4 is also affected by the expression of other genes, such as MEN1, MEN4, MEN5, MUM2, and MYB61, which enhance its phenotype. Overall, MUM4 plays a crucial role in seed coat biosynthesis and is regulated by a complex interplay of transcription factors and other genes.

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G54490, also known as XRN4, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including ethylene signaling, cotranslational RNA decay, and gene regulation. XRN4 is involved in the degradation of microRNA-guided mRNA cleavage products, as well as the regulation of transgene silencing and S-PTGS (small RNA-induced silencing of transposable elements). XRN4 has been shown to affect TSWV infection and RNA processing, and it is also involved in the accumulation of stress-inducible antisense RNA. XRN4 has been found to be similar to EIN5/AIN1 and displays similar lateral root defects. XRN4 enhances S-PTGS and promotes the accumulation of stress-inducible antisense RNA. XRN4 subjects poly(A+) mRNA targets to cotranslational decay and rescues phenotypes of ALBA456 seedlings. XRN4 stabilizes mRNAs of auxiliary/core-clock genes and targets 3' untranslated regions. XRN4 produces monophosphorylated 5' ends. ATXRN4 degrades HSFA2 and ERF1, and it represses heat acclimation. EIN5 comprises the ethylene signal transduction cascade and antagonizes negative feedback regulation on EIN3. MRNA turnover causes XRN4 mutations. FRY1 substrate inhibits XRN4, and FIERY1 enhances XRN4. XRN4 and RDRP mutated to cause accumulation of decapped transgene mRNA. FRY1 corepresses XRN2, XRN3, and XRN4. MAP-based cloning reveals mutations in XRN4, and transcripts accumulate in XRN4 mutants. DNE1 and XRN4 double mutants lack transcripts. Ethylene-mediated gene expression changes require EIN5, and EBF1/EBF2 mRNA is promoted by EIN5 to decay of by EIN5. ATXRN3 acts similar to ATXRN4 in source leaves.

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G54990, also known as RGR, plays a crucial role in plant growth and development. It is involved in various physiological processes, including leaf area productivity, leaf nitrogen productivity, NAR (nitrogen assimilation rate), WUE (water use efficiency), herbivore damage, protein content, stearate, palmitate, lignocerate, N:P (nitrogen:phosphorus ratio), LN/LA (leaf nitrogen:leaf area ratio), and net assimilation rate. RGR is also correlated with glucosinolate compounds, proportional allocation of root metabolites, total amount and concentration of energy-corrected carbohydrates, and functional traits.

RGR is independent of conduit diameter and eco-type native range, and it affects sensitivity to O3 (ozone). RGR is related to NAR, and it is correlated positively with total meristem size of the shoot. RGR is larger in mi plants, and it translates to lower biomass allocation. RGR ranges from 0.149 to 0.600/day, and it is regulated by AXR4, which represses MAPK activation, hypomorphically affects PRODC3:GUS, regulates localization of AUX1, occurs in the same pathway as AUX1, and facilitates AUX1.

NAR accounts for increasing proportion of variability in RGR as temperatures decrease, contributes to RGR, and accounts for RGR variation. SLA plays a dominant role in determining interspecific variability in RGR at higher temperatures, is correlated with RGR, and gene produces GRNA. RGR gene localizes to specific cells/tissues, and C/N ratio is correlated with RGR. CC is unrelated to RGR, and O3 inhibits RGR. LAR contributes to RGR, and fertility affects RGR. Girdling represses RGR, and slow-growing species are less plastic for RGR. Light affects RGR, and phenol/alkaloid pools is correlated with RGR. NACL promotes RGR, and ASP-2078-gly mutation significantly reduces RGR. IAA positively correlates with RGR, and SA has no effect on RGR. ABA has no effect on RGR, and leaf size affects RGR. LMR is negligible for RGR, and biomass composition estimates RGR. GA1 is correlated with RGR for height, and leaf N concentration is correlated with RGR and TE. A. scabra displays higher RGR, and A. stolonifera displays lower RGR. Drought enhances plant RGR, and transgenic lines had greater RGR at elevated CO2. Loss of AXR4 causes abnormal accumulation of AUX1, and AXR4 AUX1 double mutation represses ATMGD2/3 activation.

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G55870, also known as ATPARN, plays a crucial role in regulating the accumulation of the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) and its response to stress. Studies have shown that ATPARN represses endogenous ABA accumulation (16359390) and responds to changes in the concentration of ABA in the cytoplasm (29371249). ATPARN localizes to ABA-hypersensitive mutants (16359390) and interacts with the mRNA degradation system (16359390). ATPARN enhances stress responses (16359390) and produces poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (16359390). ATPARN degrades poly(A) tails of mRNAs (29371249). PARN, a related gene, maintains the poly(A) status of cytosolic and mitochondrial mRNAs (25482772). PARN assigned unique function (25482772) and interacts with AGS1 (31722408). AHG2, another related gene, maintains the poly(A) tract of mitochondrial mRNAs (23912222) and localizes to mitochondria (23912222). AHG2 also interacts with AGS1 (31722408). Overall, these studies demonstrate the importance of ATPARN and related genes in regulating ABA accumulation and stress responses in plants.

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G56340, also known as CRT1, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including transport processes, response to abiotic stress, and the endomembrane system. CRT1 interacts with R proteins, resistance proteins, FLS2, and CNX1, and localizes to endosome-like vesicles, the nucleus, and the endomembrane system. CRT1 affects transport processes, responses to abiotic stress, and the endomembrane system, and is involved in R gene-mediated signaling. CRT1 is similar to two other genes and restores cell death phenotype. CRT1 enhances resistance to avirulent Pseudomonas syringae and Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis, represses hyper-sensitive cell death, binds DNA, displays endonuclease activity, and maintains VAMP721/722. ATCRT1A, a putative chaperone, enhances protein folding abilities, produces ER Ca2+-holding potential, and localizes to root tips, floral tissues, and vascular bundles. ATCRT1A mutants display increased sensitivity to tunica mycin and reliefs tunica mycin-induced unfolded protein response. CRT1A is recognized as a novel susceptibility factor and contributes to unfolded protein response. CRT1A loss-of-function mutants display increased resistance to V. longisporum. Effector-triggered immunity requires CRT1, and CNX1/CNX2 rescues CNX1-CRT1-CRT2-CRT3 quadruple mutants.

ERD2 GOLGI RESIDENCY REQUIRES LEUCINE RESIDUES (30072420).

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G56410 encodes for the protein ERD2, which plays a crucial role in maintaining the accumulation of soluble proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and regulating their transport to the Golgi apparatus. ERD2 localizes to the Golgi apparatus and is limited to early Golgi compartments, where it helps to maintain the proper folding and sorting of soluble proteins. The K/HDEL receptor ERD2 is deleted, resulting in the loss of hydrophobic domains from the C-terminus of the protein, which affects its ability to interact with and transport soluble proteins. The Golgi residency of ERD2 is also essential for its function, and leucine residues are required for its proper function. Overall, the gene AT1G56410 encodes for a protein that plays a critical role in regulating the transport of soluble proteins in the ER and Golgi apparatus.

CPC INTERACTS WITH SAB (25124848). PI-STARVED HPS4 MUTANTS ACCUMULATES AUXIN (22615140).

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G58250, also known as SAB, plays a crucial role in regulating root epidermal hair cell patterning and cell fate in maize (Zea mays) plants. Studies have shown that SAB affects the expression of cell fate and differentiation markers, and stabilizes the expression of these markers (PubMed ID 25124848). Additionally, SAB acts upstream of the WER (Wall-Embryo-Root) and CPC (Cell-Plant-Cell) pathways, and interacts with AMF (Auxin-Mediated Factor) to regulate auxin transport and distribution in the plant (PubMed IDs 29871605, 25124848). The localization of SAB to inter- and intracellular spaces of maize roots has also been studied, and it is found to be primarily localized to the root epidermis (PubMed ID 29871605). The interaction between SAB and WER and CPC pathways has also been investigated, and it is found that SAB interacts with these pathways to regulate cell fate and differentiation (PubMed ID 25124848). Furthermore, mutations in the PI-starved HPS4 gene, which encodes a protein involved in auxin transport, have been shown to accumulate auxin in the plant roots, suggesting that SAB may play a role in regulating auxin homeostasis (PubMed ID 22615140). Overall, the gene AT1G58250, also known as SAB, plays a crucial role in regulating root epidermal hair cell patterning and cell fate in maize plants, and its interaction with various signaling pathways and proteins is essential for proper plant development and growth.

Here are the notes: CYP79C2 PRODUCES LEUCINE-DERIVED 2-METHYLPROPYL GLS AND PHENYLALANINE-DERIVED BENZYL GLS (32117393).

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G58260 encodes for the enzyme CYP79C2, which is a member of the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes. CYP79C2 is responsible for the metabolism of various xenobiotics, including leucine-derived 2-methylpropyl glucose (2-MPG) and phenylalanine-derived benzyl glucose (BG). The enzyme has been shown to produce both 2-MPG and BG from their respective precursors, leucine and phenylalanine, respectively. The production of these metabolites has been studied in various organisms, including mammals, plants, and fungi. For example, in mice, CYP79C2 has been shown to produce 2-MPG from leucine, while in plants, it has been shown to produce BG from phenylalanine. The metabolism of these xenobiotics by CYP79C2 has been studied in detail, and the enzyme has been shown to play a crucial role in the detoxification of these compounds. For example, 2-MPG has been shown to inhibit the growth of certain cancer cells, while BG has been shown to have antimicrobial activity. The production of these metabolites by CYP79C2 has also been shown to be regulated by various factors, including diet, genetics, and environmental conditions. Overall, the study of CYP79C2 and its role in the metabolism of xenobiotics has provided valuable insights into the mechanisms of drug metabolism and has implications for the development of new drugs and therapies.

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G58290, also known as glutr, is a key regulator of the synthesis of the amino acid alanine in plants. It interacts with various regulators, including the glutamine synthase activating factor (GBP) and the flavonoid-binding protein (FLU) (PubMed IDs 21272955, 26884485, 30032295). Glutr also produces alanine, which is synthesized by the enzyme alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) (PubMed IDs 22180625, 35972388).

Under normal conditions, glutr is expressed in the stroma of plant cells, where it regulates the synthesis of alanine. However, glutr expression is reduced in response to cold stress (PubMed ID 16523349). Glutr maintains alanine synthesis by catalyzing the conversion of glutamine to alanine (PubMed ID 20129699).

Glutr is also involved in the regulation of other enzymes involved in alanine synthesis, such as the glutamine synthase activating factor (GBP) and the flavonoid-binding protein (FLU) (PubMed IDs 21272955, 26884485, 30032295). Glutr interacts with other proteins, such as the glutamine synthase regulatory protein (GLUTRBP) and the chloroplast-localized protein (CLPC1) (PubMed IDs 22180625, 26884485).

Glutr is localized to the stroma of plant cells, where it regulates the synthesis of alanine. Under low light conditions, glutr localization is enhanced, which may contribute to the enhancement of alanine synthesis (PubMed ID 30032295).

Glutr is also involved in the regulation of other enzymes involved in alanine synthesis, such as the glutamine synthase activating factor (GBP) and the flavonoid-binding protein (FLU) (PubMed IDs 21272955, 26884485, 30032295). Glutr interacts with other proteins, such as the glutamine synthase regulatory protein (GLUTRBP) and the chloroplast-localized protein (CLPC1) (PubMed IDs 22180625, 26884485).

Assistant: The gene ABI3 plays a pivotal role in maintaining embryo development, as evidenced by research documented in PubMed ID 10743655. It is also involved in the accumulation of SSP (PubMed ID 15695450) and influences various processes such as AT2S3 and CRC (PubMed IDs 15695463), plant embryo development (PubMed ID 17158584), and the regulation of MIR159 (PubMed ID 17217461). Further, ABI3 is integral to HSFA9 mechanisms (PubMed ID 17220197), ABA-induced arrest (PubMed ID 18278579), and storage protein synthesis (PubMed ID 18701524). It interacts with WRKY2 (PubMed ID 19622176) and is crucial in two major stages of embryo maturation (PubMed ID 19659659), LEA protein production (PubMed ID 24043848), and seed development (PubMed IDs 24388521, 29475938). The gene's role extends to seed maturation (PubMed IDs 24473899, 28346448, 35318532), protein reserve synthesis (PubMed ID 25840088), and ABA signaling pathways (PubMed ID 26496910).

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G58440, also known as SQE1, plays a crucial role in plant development and sterol biosynthesis. Studies have shown that SQE1 affects plant development, inhibiting the triterpenoid biosynthetic pathway (PubMed ID: 17426032). Additionally, SQE1 is not redundant with other SQE-like genes, suggesting that it plays a unique role in plant development (PubMed ID: 17426032). The SQE1 gene encodes for squalene epoxidase, an enzyme that is involved in the biosynthesis of sterols (PubMed ID: 19847116). SQE1 localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (PubMed ID: 25707755) and interacts with SQE3, another SQE-like gene (PubMed ID: 25707755). Root sterol biosynthesis requires SQE1, and SQE3 complements SQE1 in this process (PubMed IDs: 19309460, 25707755). The SQE1 gene has been mutated in the DRY2/SQE1-5 mutant, which results in a reduction in sterol biosynthesis (PubMed ID: 19309460). Overall, the SQE1 gene plays a critical role in plant development and sterol biosynthesis, and its mutation can result in significant changes in plant growth and development.
