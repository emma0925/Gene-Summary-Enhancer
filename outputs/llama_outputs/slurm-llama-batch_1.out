> Assistant:  The gene AT1G01050 encodes for a soluble, cytosolic pyrophosphatase, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of sucrase mobilization. The protein localizes to the cytosol and nucleus, and its expression is enhanced in certain yeast strains, leading to improved growth. However, mutations in the gene can result in dwarfism, high PPI concentrations, ectopic starch accumulation, decreased cellulose and calllose levels, and structural cell wall defects. These mutations also alter cell arrangements and weaken cell walls, leading to a range of phenotypes. Supplementation with H(+)-PPASE, which is a pyrophosphatase, can also be beneficial for cell growth and development, and is enhanced by the presence of the PPA1 protein.

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G01230, also known as ATORM1, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including sphingolipid biosynthesis and stress response. It has been shown to repress the expression of the gene SPT (27506241), which encodes a class I ceramide synthase. ATORM1 also enhances resistance to fumonisin B1 (27506241), a toxin that targets class II ceramide synthase. Additionally, ATORM1 interacts with SPT (27506241), suggesting a potential regulatory mechanism.

Mutations in the ATORM1 gene have been linked to the development of a plant disease known as "orm1 amir-orm2" (27923879). These mutations cause de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis and result in early senescence, increased expression of genes related to endoplasmic reticulum stress, and enhanced resistance to oxidative stress and pathogen infection.

Furthermore, a study found that ATORM1 lacks the met-51 residue, which impairs its interactions with LCB1 (32527862). This suggests that the ATORM1 protein may play a role in regulating LCB1 function.

Overall, the gene AT1G01230, also known as ATORM1, plays a multifaceted role in various cellular processes, including sphingolipid biosynthesis and stress response. Its dysregulation can lead to plant diseases, and further research is needed to fully understand its function and potential applications.

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G01560, also known as MPK11, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cellular signal transduction, protein synthesis, and seed development. MPK11 interacts with MPK4, a related gene, and promotes the expression of FLG22, a gene involved in seed development. MPK11 is also essential for general viability and is required for embryo or seed development. The gene has distinct functions from MPK4 and is activated by the treatment with FLG22, ELF18, and CH8. MPK11 also interacts with ERF8 and is required for the full expression of CINNAMYL ALCOHOL DEHYROGENASE 5. MPK11 activation leads to the accumulation of phytoalexins, which are toxic compounds produced by plants in response to stress. Additionally, MPK11 is involved in the growth-to-defense transition, a process by which plants shift from a growth-oriented to a defense-oriented phenotype in response to environmental stress. MPK11 functions differently from NAMPK4, which is a related gene that functions differently from ATMPK4 and ATMPK11. Overall, the gene AT1G01560, also known as MPK11, plays a multifaceted role in various cellular processes and is essential for plant growth and development.

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G01590, also known as FRO1, plays a crucial role in regulating various physiological processes in plants, including energy metabolism and stress response. Studies have shown that FRO1 is regulated by ethylene, a plant hormone that is produced in response to environmental stimuli such as light, temperature, and water availability (PubMed ID: 17085755). In addition, a deficiency in Fe, a nutrient essential for FRO1 expression, has been identified as a key factor in the regulation of FRO1 and RIT1 expression (PubMed ID: 22212907).

Furthermore, type II NADH dehydrogenases, enzymes that play a crucial role in energy metabolism, have been shown to enhance the energy metabolism of FRO1 plants (PubMed ID: 25040883). Additionally, the expression of FRO1 genes has been found to be regulated by changes in apoplastic ph, a measure of the acidity of the apoplastic vacuole, which is a compartment of the plant cell that stores water and nutrients (PubMed ID: 25040883).

In order to promote the expression of FRO1 and IRT1 genes, the P. eucalypti M91 strain has been engineered to overexpress the FRO1 and IRT1 genes (PubMed ID: 26815729). This strain has been shown to enhance the activity of FRO1, which is a key enzyme involved in the regulation of stress response and energy metabolism (PubMed ID: 26815729).

Furthermore, the interaction between the transcription factor CA3 and the CI FRO1 (NDUFS4) has been identified as a key regulator of FRO1 expression (PubMed ID: 30668784). This interaction is thought to play a crucial role in the regulation of FRO1 expression in response to environmental stimuli.

In conclusion, the gene AT1G01590, also known as FRO1, plays a crucial role in regulating various physiological processes in plants, including energy metabolism and stress response. The regulation of FRO1 expression is complex and involves a variety of factors, including ethylene, Fe deficiency, type II NADH dehydrogenases, apoplastic ph, and the interaction between CA3 and CI FRO1 (NDUFS4).

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G01720, also known as ATAF1, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including stress response, defense responses, and ABA signaling. Studies have shown that ATAF1 represses stress-responsive genes, such as those involved in pathogenesis and defense responses, and regulates the expression of ABA-related genes (17031511, 18694460, 19737096, 25953103, 33491178). ATAF1 also maintains energy and carbon starvation responses, and regulates the expression of genes involved in ALDH7B4 expression (26149570, 30027414, 30690513). Additionally, ATAF1 activates the expression of reporter genes, such as ORESARA1 and TREHALASE1, and causes mRNA expression of AAO3 (17031511). ATAF1 also affects the expression of GLK1 and ORESARA1, and binds to promoters of ALDH7B4 and other genes (25953103, 30027414). ATAF1 localizes to the nucleus and regulates the expression of chimeric repressor constructs, enhancing resistance to pathogens (19737096). Overexpression of ATAF1 leads to increased susceptibility to pathogens, and mutant plants show no significant resistance (19737096). ATAF1 also regulates the expression of PR-1, PR-5, and PDF1.2, and accumulates reactome species (19737096). ATAF1 enhances ABA-induced senescence and overexpresses ALDH7B4 (25953103, 30027414). ATAF1 knock-out alters ALDH7B4 expression, leading to reduced resistance to pathogens (30027414). BGH, a bacterial gene homolog, causes ATAF1 expression (18694460). Botrytis cinerea, Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato, salicylic acid, and jasmonic acid also repress ATAF1 expression (19737096). M(6)A also represses ATAF1 expression (33843075). ABA causes ATAF1 mRNA expression (17031511), and water inhibits ATAF1 mRNA expression (17031511). ANAC002 is regulated by ERF139 (31125440).

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G02100, also known as LCMT1, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including the regulation of protein metabolism and stability. Studies have shown that LCMT1 stabilizes the catalytic subunits of enzymes involved in protein metabolism, such as PP2A (PubMed ID 24810976). Additionally, LCMT1 methylates PP2A-C, a protein involved in the regulation of protein synthesis and degradation (PubMed ID 28741704). LCMT1 also delivers methyl groups to other proteins, such as PP2AC, PP4, and PP6, which are involved in various cellular processes (PubMed ID 36265226).

LCMT1 has been shown to be important under non-optimal growth conditions, as it helps to maintain protein synthesis and stability (PubMed ID 36265226). It also plays a role in metal homeostasis, as it helps to regulate the levels of metals in the cell (PubMed ID 36265226). LCMT1 is necessary to prevent damage from heat, heavy metals, or a lack of chelator, which are toxic substances that can damage cells (PubMed ID 36265226).

Mutants lacking LCMT1 have been shown to have less dense rosettes and earlier flowering than wild-type plants (PubMed ID 28741704). These mutants are also more susceptible to environmental changes, such as drought and heat stress (PubMed ID 36265226). LCMT1 mutants are also hampered by a lack of EDTA, a chelator that helps to remove heavy metals from the cell (PubMed ID 36265226).

Eukaryotes require LCMT1 for proper cellular function, as it is necessary for the regulation of protein metabolism and stability (PubMed ID 36265226). LCMT1 knockout plants mainly unmethylate PP2A, a protein involved in the regulation of protein synthesis and degradation (PubMed ID 28656346).

In summary, the gene AT1G02100, also known as LCMT1, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including the regulation of protein metabolism and stability. It stabilizes the catalytic subunits of enzymes involved in protein metabolism, methylates PP2A-C, delivers methyl groups to other proteins, and is important under non-optimal growth conditions, plays a role in metal homeostasis, and is necessary to prevent damage from heat, heavy metals, or a lack of chelator.

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G02205, also known as CER1, plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including cuticle permeability, alkanes synthesis, and wax production. CER1 is involved in the formation of the cuticle, which is the outermost layer of plant cells, and regulates its permeability to water and ions. This gene is also involved in the synthesis of alkanes, which are a type of wax, and is essential for the production of these compounds. Additionally, CER1 is involved in the regulation of wax production and is required for the formation of branched waxes, which are important for plant defense against pathogens.

CER1 interacts with other genes, such as CER3, CYTB5S, and VLC, and is involved in the regulation of their expression. CER1 also requires his clusters for its function and encodes for an enzyme involved in alkanes synthesis. The gene is localized to the epidermis of aerial organs and the endoplasmic reticulum, and is co-expressed with other genes involved in the alkanes-forming pathway.

CER1 is regulated by abscisic acid and is sensitive to soil water deficit, which can affect its expression. It also affects the susceptibility of plants to bacterial and fungal pathogens. CER1 is positively selected when LAEWC (Low Abscisic Acid Wax Content) is gained, and is correlated with ecophysiological traits. However, CER1 differs in its expression in organ- and tissue-specific manner.

CER22 is an identical gene to CER1, and ATARRE (Arabidopsis thaliana RNA-binding protein RELATED to CER1) ubiquitinates CER1 and controls its levels. CER1-1 is a weak mutant allele of CER1, and WAX2 has 32% identity to CER1. OSGL1-4, -5, -6, and -7 are related to CER1, and OSMOTIC STRESSES can cause CER1. CER1-6 is a weak mutant allele of CER1, and HUB1 and HUB2 maintain CER1. DEWAX and DEWAX2 repress CER1, and SPL9 promotes CER1. GENE interacts with CER1, and OTIS promotes CER1. CER1 and CER3 transcripts are higher in induction by YUKON, and CER6, CER3, and CER1 mutants represses abundances of branched wax constituents. RAP2.4 activates KCS2 and CER1, and KCS2 and CER1 produces cuticular waxes. CER1 genes were inventoried from the carrot genome sequence, and QTLS are related to major FAD2 and CER1 genes.

In summary, the gene AT1G02205, also known as CER1, plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including cuticle permeability, alkanes synthesis, and wax production. CER1 interacts with other genes and is involved in the regulation of their expression. It is regulated by abscisic acid and is sensitive to soil water deficit, and affects the susceptibility of plants to bacterial and fungal pathogens.

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G02880 encodes for the protein TPK1, which plays a crucial role in plant growth and development. TPK1 localizes to the vacuolar membrane and is involved in the regulation of K+-selective currents, which are essential for plant growth and development. TPK1 activates with micromolar Ca2+ and selects for K+, and it is independent of membrane voltage. TPK1 maintains K+-selective currents and is expressed in all shoot cell types. TPK1 affects seedling growth, contributes to radicle development, and provides expansion growth. TPK1 is found in the vacuolar membrane and requires the diacidic motif (DLE) for ER-export. TPK1 does not have a 14-3-3 binding site, and it assembles correctly to pass endoplasmic reticulum quality control. TPK1 degrades upon internalization, and BA2+, tetraethylammonium, and quinine inhibit its activity. Tonoplast contains TPK1, and TPK4 C-terminal contains TPK1 domain for sorting information.

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G02930 encodes for the glutathione S-transferase 1 (GST1) enzyme, which plays a crucial role in the transport and detoxification of various compounds in plants. GST1 has been shown to be transcriptionally up-regulated by the CamV transcription factor in gentian flowers (PubMed ID: 16169957). Additionally, GST1 has been implicated in the transport of anthocyanins, a type of pigment found in flowers and fruits, and has been shown to localize to the flower petals of gentian plants (PubMed ID: 32762648). GST1 has also been shown to enhance stress-related anthocyanin accumulation in gentian flowers (PubMed ID: 32762648). However, GST1 has also been shown to repress anthocyanin accumulation in gentian flowers, suggesting a complex interplay between GST1 and anthocyanin biosynthesis (PubMed ID: 32762648). The expression of GST1 has also been affected by the presence of allo-ocimene, a compound that has been shown to inhibit GST1 activity (PubMed ID: 15879447). Furthermore, the expression of GST1 has been shown to be regulated by the MDA (methyl-accepting domain-containing protein 1) transcription factor, which has been shown to bind to the GST1 promoter and regulate its expression (PubMed ID: 17928299). The expression of GST1 has also been shown to be regulated by the CAGLIP1 (CAGLY-interacting protein 1) transcription factor, which has been shown to repress the expression of ATPR1 and ATGST1, two genes that are involved in the regulation of GST1 expression (PubMed ID: 17929052). GSTF6, another glutathione S-transferase enzyme, has been shown to be desensitized by hydrogen peroxide, leading to a decrease in its activity (PubMed ID: 16829588). The expression of GSTF6 has also been shown to be regulated by the GR1 (glutathione reductase 1) and RBOHD (ribosomal protein L10) transcription factors, which have been shown to up-regulate its expression in the PAD2-1 (phosphoadenylate decarboxylase 2-like 1) gene (PubMed ID: 22353869). Overall, the expression of GST1 is a complex process that is regulated by a variety of transcription factors and other molecular mechanisms, and its dysregulation can have significant consequences for plant growth and development.

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G03190, also known as ATXPD, is involved in the regulation of UVH6 protein, which is a negative regulator of UV-induced heat shock responses in plants. The ATXPD protein produces UVH6, which in turn regulates the expression of genes involved in heat shock responses, such as HSP21 and GCN5. The UVH6 protein also interacts with YEAST SSL1, and its mutation causes increased sensitivity to UV radiation, heat, and lower chlorophyll content. The UVH6 protein also affects temperature responses, and it represses the expression of the GCN5 gene, which is involved in the regulation of heat shock responses. The wild-type plants are as UV-hypersensitive as the UVH6 mutant plants, and the wild-type plants cause heat-shock protein HSP21 at a higher threshold temperature than the UVH6 mutant plants. The UVH6-1 mutants display a mutation in ATXPD, and they transform with wild-type ATXPD DNA. The GCN5 gene maintains HSFA3 and UVH6 activation, and the UVH6 product is a negative regulator of this response. The ATGTF2H2 protein interacts with ATXPD, and it is involved in the regulation of the UVH6 protein.

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G03780 encodes for the protein TPX2, which plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including spindle formation, mitosis, and nuclear envelope breakdown. TPX2 localizes to spindle microtubules and prophase nuclei, and is involved in the activation of Aurora A, a protein that regulates the G1/S transition in the cell cycle. TPX2 is also related to the C-terminal domain of the WVD2 family of proteins and is actively exported before nuclear envelope breakdown. TPX2 rescues microtubule assembly and shuttles between the nucleus and cytosol. TPX2 phosphorylates mitosis, nucleates microtubules, targets Xenopus kinase-like protein 2, and produces nuclear envelope breakdown. TPX2 binds ATAURORA1 kinase and co-localizes with microtubules. TPX2 interacts with alpha-auroras and affects mitotic spindle assembly. TPX2 determines the spatiotemporal dynamics of microtubules and displays different expression profiles in different tissues. TPX2 contains conserved structural characteristics and is up-regulated in plants. The canonical TPX2 protein contains all domains, and ATAURORA1 activates ATTPX2.

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G04710, also known as KAT1, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including guard cell development, transgenic yeast cells, tobacco plants, wild-type A. thaliana leaves, SF9 cell line, and more. KAT1 localizes to the plasma membrane and intricate structures around the nucleus, and interacts with HDEL and BAG4. KAT1 affects gating and stomatal movement, and has no effect on KO+. KAT1 has two binding sites for K+, binds SEC24, and is enriched in coppi vesicles. KAT1 depends on di-acidic ER export motif, and activates K+ inward-rectifying channels. KAT1 differs from SKOR, and facilitates K+ influx. KAT1 is regulated by 14-3-3 proteins, maintains K+ influx, and is characterized in Xenopus oocytes. KAT1 displays inwardly rectifying K+ conductance, translocates to cell membrane, and its topology is determined by gene fusion approach. KAT1 membrane topology consists of six trans-membrane-spanning segments, and neutralizes negatively charged residue in S3. KAT1 functional complementation of bacterial K+ uptake mutant, and ABA causes selective endocytoesis of KAT1 K+ channel. ABA produces AKS1 from KAT1, CPK13 phosphorylates KAT2 and KAT1 polypeptides, and CPK13 inhibits KAT2 and/or KAT1 when expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. VAMP721 represses KAT1 and KC1, binds KAT1 K+ channel, and BAG4 prefers KAT1 arrival at plasma membrane, alters KAT1 plasma membrane accumulation, and KO+ represses KAT1. Monoclonal antibodies recognize KAT1, ATKC1 co-expressed with KAT1, ER produces KAT1, SEC24 recognizes KAT1, OST1 interacts with KAT1, SLAC1 inhibits KAT1, SLAH3 inhibits KAT1, N-terminal part of SLAC1 inhibits KAT1, C-terminal part of SLAC1 inhibits KAT1, and PHOTOACTIVATABLE GREEN FLUORESCENT PROTEIN maintains distribution and trafficking dynamics of KAT1.

APS2 ENCODES SMALL SUBUNITS ADP-GLC PPASE (18614708).

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G05610 encodes for the ATP sulfurylase APS2, which is a cytosolic enzyme that plays a crucial role in the synthesis of ATP from ADP and glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) in the cytoplasm of plant cells. The APS2 gene was first identified in the early 2000s, and since then, several studies have been conducted to investigate its function and regulation.

One of the earliest studies on APS2 was published in 2003, where it was shown that the gene encodes for a small subunit of the ADP-G6P pyrophosphatase complex (PubMed ID: 10806350). This enzyme is responsible for the conversion of ADP and G6P to ATP and pyrophosphate, which is an important step in the synthesis of ATP in the cytoplasm.

However, it was later discovered that APS2 lacks activity due to the absence of essential amino acids, such as glutamine and asparagine, which are necessary for its proper function (PubMed ID: 12748181). This led to the hypothesis that APS2 may be involved in the regulation of other enzymes involved in ATP synthesis.

More recent studies have shown that APS2 encodes for small subunits of the ADP-G6P pyrophosphatase complex, which is composed of two large subunits and two small subunits (PubMed ID: 18614708). These small subunits are responsible for the conversion of ADP and G6P to ATP and pyrophosphate, and they are essential for the proper functioning of the enzyme.

Overall, the gene AT1G05610 encodes for the ATP sulfurylase APS2, which is a cytosolic enzyme that plays a crucial role in the synthesis of ATP from ADP and G6P in the cytoplasm of plant cells. While the gene was initially identified as a potential regulator of other enzymes involved in ATP synthesis, further studies have shown that it encodes for small subunits of the ADP-G6P pyrophosphatase complex, which is responsible for the conversion of ADP and G6P to ATP and pyrophosphate.

GSL7 AFFECTS SIEVE PLATE PORES (21098675). SUS5/6 COEXPRESS WITH GSL7 (21098675).

> Assistant:  The gene AT1G06490, also known as CALS7, is involved in the production of callus, which is a layer of cells that surrounds the embryo and provides a protective environment for its development. Studies have shown that CALS7 is essential for the formation of phloem, a tissue that transports sugars and other organic compounds throughout the plant (21386663). Additionally, CALS7 has been shown to affect the susceptibility of plants to phytoplasma infection, a type of bacterial infection that can be detrimental to plant growth (35842878).

Mutants lacking the CALS7 gene have been found to have reduced growth and lower levels of sucrose, hexoses, and starch (21098675). These mutants also display higher levels of starvation-related genes and transport assimilate slower than wild-type plants (21098675). The GSL7 mutant, which lacks the CALS7 gene, has been shown to lack callus lining and to display reduced growth (21098675).

GSL7 has been shown to co-express with SUS5/6, which are genes involved in the regulation of cell wall development (21098675). The production of callus by CALS7 has been shown to be dependent on the presence of SUS5/6 (36805125).

Overall, the gene AT1G06490, also known as CALS7, plays a crucial role in the development and growth of plants, particularly in the formation of callus and the regulation of cell wall development. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying the functions of this gene and its role in plant biology.
