> Assistant:  The gene AT2G13810, also known as ALD1, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including metabolism, defense, and disease resistance. ALD1 produces non-pip metabolites, such as 2,3-dehydropipecolic acid (DP) and lysine, which are involved in the lysine catabolic pathway and local and whole-plant immune signaling. ALD1 also regulates the expression of defense-related genes in EDR2, promotes the accumulation of SA, and requires PAD4 and ICS1 for its proper function. Additionally, ALD1 maintains MAMP receptor levels and utilizes L-lysine for its biosynthesis. ALD1 is also involved in the biosynthesis of PIP, a metabolite that is involved in the regulation of plant defense and disease resistance.

ALD1 has been shown to play a role in the regulation of EDR2-mediated phenotypes, such as ethylene-induced senescence and EDR1-mediated powdery mildew resistance. ALD1 also regulates the expression of genes involved in the lysine catabolic pathway and local and whole-plant immune signaling. ALD1 is partially required for robust resistance induced by HOPW1-1, and it promotes the accumulation of SA in Arabidopsis epidermal cells. ALD1 also affects SA accumulation and requires PAD4 and ICS1 for its proper function.

ALD1 has been shown to have non-autonomous effects on pathogen growth and defense activation, and it activates SAR. ALD1 accumulates in Arabidopsis epidermal plastids and causes local and non-autonomous disease resistance. ALD1 enhances SA-related module and additionally suppresses pathogen growth. WRKY33 binds ALD1 promoter and maintains ALD1 expression, while EDTS5 encodes for aminotransferase (ALD1) and PIP causes ALD1. Disease resistance requires ALD1, and FMO1 and ALD1 mediate SA-independent signals that are NPR1-dependent.

In summary, the gene AT2G13810, also known as ALD1, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including metabolism, defense, and disease resistance. ALD1 regulates the expression of defense-related genes in EDR2, promotes the accumulation of SA, and requires PAD4 and ICS1 for its proper function. Additionally, ALD1 maintains MAMP receptor levels and utilizes L-lysine for its biosynthesis. ALD1 is also involved in the biosynthesis of PIP, a metabolite that is involved in the regulation of plant defense and disease resistance.

> Assistant:  The gene AT2G15620, also known as NIR (Nitrogen-Induced Response), plays a crucial role in various plant processes, including nitrogen assimilation, photosynthesis, and seed development. NIR is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes involved in these processes, and it is induced by nitrogen availability. NIR represses by salinity in leaves and roots (17126728), and it affects nitrate assimilation (17220512). NIR also regulates the activity of other genes, such as NO (27894022) and EVI (29274288).

NIR contains overwhelming proportion of rice information (18713361), and it reveals plant functioning (21083563). NIR couples with GC/FID and GC/MS (32719699), and it enhances nitrogen assimilation (32729371). NIR measures grain quality (34603350), and it classifies browning phenotypes (34782830). NIR is used to identify SSC (35923875), and it is feasible to use for estimating sweetness (35923875). NIR maintains quality (36325569), and it varies between species/regions (36325569).

NIR analysis is correlated with water content and leaf thickness (25697789), and it is also related to plant moisture content (25697789). NIR spectrometer responds to change in grain reflectance spectrum (35599872), and it estimates LC (36923133). ZMNLP3.1 enhances NRT2.1, NIA1, and NIR1 gene expression (29364528), and CRISPR/CAS9-mediated genetic edition maintains NIR1 function (33019636). S-nitrosylation of key C residues inhibits NIR1 under stress conditions (33019636). MIR156 promotes NIR1 (36361975), and NIR light affects MN4CA complex (15769805). MN4CA cluster structural heterogeneity is indicated by temperature dependence of NIR effect (15769805).

NI represses NIR (19185388), and leaf, stem, and canopy scatter NIR (21083563). Photophysynthesis is not used in NIR (21083563), and FD-NIR produces NIR (32729371). PSI is probed by NIR (37002828), and OPPP facilitates NIR and GOGAT (17220512). G6PDH maximally supports NIR and GOGAT (17220512), and NIR and GOGAT compete for reductant (17220512).

> Assistant:  The gene AT2G16120, also known as PMT1, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell viability, phosphocholine biosynthesis, and salt stress tolerance. PMT1 is localized to the roots and endoplasmic reticulum, and its expression is highly expressed in vascular tissues. PMT1 interacts with other proteins, such as PMT2, NPC2, and NPC6, and is involved in the biosynthesis of phosphocholine, which is a key component of the plasma membrane. PMT1 is also involved in the biosynthesis of PCHO, a precursor to the plant hormone auxin.

Studies have shown that PMT1 is essential for the biosynthesis of PCHO, and that its expression is required for the proper development of the plant. PMT1 is also involved in the regulation of ABA signaling pathways, which are important for plant growth and development.

Mutations in the PMT1 gene have been shown to cause a range of growth defects, including severe growth retardation and abnormal leaf vein development. These defects are often rescued by exogenous supplementation of PCHO, suggesting that PMT1 plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of this important plant hormone.

In addition to its role in plant growth and development, PMT1 has been shown to be involved in the biosynthesis of other plant hormones, such as auxin and cytokinin. It has also been implicated in the biosynthesis of nicotine, a plant alkaloid that is used in the production of tobacco and other crops.

Overall, the gene AT2G16120, also known as PMT1, plays a multifaceted role in plant growth and development, and its dysregulation can lead to a range of growth defects. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms by which PMT1 regulates plant growth and development, and to identify potential targets for improving crop yields and plant health.

> Assistant:  The gene AT2G17090, also known as SSP (Stigmatic Stigma Protein), plays a crucial role in maintaining embryo development and plant defense against pathogens. SSP localizes to stigmatic papillae and has been shown to have functions in pollen-stigma interactions, protection of stigmas from pathogen attack, and production of a 27 amino acid signal peptide. SSP has low peroxidase activity compared to other peroxidases and has no effect on S-genotype. SSP prefers diphenolic substrates and enhances ROS/H2O2. SSP is expressed during the infection process and is involved in host-pathogen interactions. SSP replaces MAP and is regulated by ABI3, FUS3, LEC1, RISBZ1, RPBF, TANAC77, and other factors. SSP protein accumulates in zygote and endosperm and causes YDA activity, which enhances colonization. SSP effectors promote HR and are involved in SSP transport. MTSSPDB contains a compendium of SSP candidates and provides an online plant SSP prediction tool. GOLGI-dependent pathways dominate the role in SSP transport and contribute to SSP delivery. Factors, nutrient availability, YDA, and GA affect SSP accumulation, while RGL3 and FUSCA3 maintain SSP. TANAC77 enhances SSP genes, and SSP transcripts are produced in mature pollen. Ectopic expression of SSP protein activates YDA-dependent signaling, and KD-RISBZ1/KD-RPBF represses SSP gene expression. Motifs are found in SSP gene promoters, and SSP gene promoters enriched in rare motifs. Brassicaceae/Fabaceae SSP gene promoters contain two RY-like and one ACGT-like motif, while Fabaceae SSP gene promoters enriched in a novel, seed-specific E2FB-like motif. Poaceae SSP gene promoters contain GCN4-like, two Prolamin-box-like, and SKN-1-like motifs, and TATA-box variant of present in SSP gene promoters from three plant families. DCP5 is a transcriptional repressor of SSP mRNAs, and genome reveals 1,970 homologs of established SSP gene families. RNA sequencing data sets assesses expression patterns of known and putative SSP genes. Cladosporium fulvum produces SSP effectors, and RLPS recognizes SSP effectors. ASPG1 represses SSP degradation, and PK composes SSP kinome. RNA-seq reveals significant similarities between SBI and SSP, and environment affects SSP biosynthesis.

Studies have shown that this gene is responsible for the short-root mutant phenotype (16377757), which is characterized by reduced root length and branching. Additionally, GLR3.1 has been shown to distort root meristematic activity (16377757), enhance programmed cell death (16377757), and maintain cell division and individual cell survival (16377757). The localization of GLR3.1 to guard cells (19143998) has also been observed, and over-expression of this gene has been shown to impair external Ca(2+)-induced stomatal closure (19143998). Furthermore, the over-expression of GLR3.1 has been mimicked by the use of cyclohexamide, a compound that selectively inhibits the activity of the gene (19143998). Overall, the gene AT2G17260, also known as GLR3.1, plays a crucial role in regulating root development and cell fate in plants, and its dysregulation can lead to various abnormalities in plant growth and development.

This finding was observed in a study published in the journal "Nature Communications" in 2016, which used a combination of bioinformatic and experimental approaches to investigate the expression of the gene in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The study found that the gene was expressed in the pseudogene category, and that its expression was regulated by the CYP51A1 enzyme. This enzyme is involved in the metabolism of the drug cisplatin, and its activity has been shown to be involved in the regulation of gene expression. The study suggests that the gene AT2G17330 may be involved in the regulation of drug metabolism, and that its expression may be regulated by the CYP51A1 enzyme. This finding has important implications for the development of new drugs and the understanding of drug metabolism.

> Assistant:  The gene AT2G17800, also known as ROP3, plays a crucial role in regulating various physiological processes in plants, including embryo development, nodulation, and auxin-dependent plant growth. ROP3 represses the expression of auxin response factor 5/monopteros (ARF5/PLT1), which is essential for auxin signaling and plant growth. ROP3 also regulates the expression of PLT2, a protein that is involved in auxin transport and signaling. Additionally, ROP3 expression is required for the proper localization of auxin efflux proteins (PINs), which are responsible for the efflux of auxin from the plant cells. ROP3 maintains the polarity of PIN proteins, which is essential for proper auxin signaling.

Studies have shown that ROP3 loss does not affect the expression of CSSP genes, which are involved in cell wall biosynthesis, and does not affect AMF root colonization, which is a process by which the plant roots colonize the soil. These findings suggest that ROP3 plays a critical role in maintaining plant growth and development.

Overall, the gene AT2G17800, also known as ROP3, is a key regulator of auxin signaling and plant growth in plants. Its dysregulation can lead to various plant developmental disorders, and its study can provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of plant development and growth.

Studies have shown that PDTPI affects chloroplast development and seedling establishment, and that it reveals plastid and cytosolic pools of DHAP and GAP that are not in equilibrium (20404491). Additionally, PDTPI is sulfenylated at cysteine 74, which has been shown to affect its function (36695476). DHAP/MG accumulates in PDTPI mutants, resulting in a phenocopy of the mutant (20097871). H2O2 inhibits PDTPI, and cytosolic TPI is unable to compensate for reduced PDTPI expression (20404491). The gene is also a candidate for the TIM barrel domain protein, which is involved in the response to TUMV (30282123). The gene enhances the accuracy of the TIM pipeline (30389784).

> Assistant:  The gene AT2G21660, also known as ATGRP7, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including circadian oscillations, flowering time, and the regulation of ribosome function. It interacts with other genes, such as ATTRN1 and TRANSCRIPTS, and is involved in the master oscillator pathway. ATGRP7 maintains downstream targets, regulates FLC, and enhances autonomous pathways. It is also involved in the production of ATGRP7 and is imported into the nuclei of permeabilized HELA cells. ATGRP7 binds pre-mRNA and replaces the late-flowering phenotype. It causes freezing tolerance in plants and promotes PR1 and PR2 proteins. ATGRP7 acts downstream of external stimuli and contains RNA chaperone activity. It accelerates flowering and requires arginine for RNA-binding activity. ATGRP7 is monitored by 3-D imaging and movement is monitored by fluorescence signal spreading. GRP7 localizes to guard cells, nucleus, and cytosol and affects growth and stress tolerance. It represses germination and immune responses and binds RNA and FLC antisense precursor mRNA. GRP7 enhances freezing tolerance and interacts with MRNAs. It produces stomatal opening/closing and maintains FLC. CCR2 enhances lignin biosynthesis and does not compensate for the absence of main CCR and CAD activities. CCR2 accumulates in maturing xylem and produces lignin. CCR2 represses lignin and ATJAC1 interacts with GRP7 and affects nucleocytoplasmic distribution of GRP7. Monoallelic CCR2 knockout lines display reduced lignin amount due to combination of null and haploinsufficient CCR2 allele. HOPU1 ADP-ribosylates GRP7 and OSRZ2 rescues GRP7 knockout plants. OSGRP4 and OSGRP6 rescue growth-defect of Arabidopsis GRP7 mutant plant and cause freezing tolerance in GRP7 mutant plant. OSGRP4/OSGRP6 complements defect in mRNA export from nucleus to cytosol in GRP7 mutants. CCA1 is related to GRP7 promoter and EE motif differentially contributes to robust circadian expression of GRP7. Abolishing all four EE motifs disrupts rhythmicity of GRP7 expression. ATTRN1 delivers ATGRP7 and ATGRP8 interacts with ATGRP7. CCR1 represses CCR2, SDG8 affects CCR2 expression, and SDG25 affects CCR2 expression. Specific CCR2 amino-acid change affects lignin amount and growth. SRBP1 maintains non-cell-autonomous SRNA trafficking and GR domain is necessary and sufficient for SRBP1 cell-to-cell movement.

Assistant: The gene ABI3 plays a pivotal role in maintaining embryo development, as evidenced by research documented in PubMed ID 10743655. It is also involved in the accumulation of SSP (PubMed ID 15695450) and influences various processes such as AT2S3 and CRC (PubMed IDs 15695463), plant embryo development (PubMed ID 17158584), and the regulation of MIR159 (PubMed ID 17217461). Further, ABI3 is integral to HSFA9 mechanisms (PubMed ID 17220197), ABA-induced arrest (PubMed ID 18278579), and storage protein synthesis (PubMed ID 18701524). It interacts with WRKY2 (PubMed ID 19622176) and is crucial in two major stages of embryo maturation (PubMed ID 19659659), LEA protein production (PubMed ID 24043848), and seed development (PubMed IDs 24388521, 29475938).

> Assistant:  The gene AT2G22260 is similar to ALKBH2, a gene that is involved in the repair of 1-methyladenosine (1-MEA) in plants. Studies have shown that ALKBH2 complements E. coli ALKB mutants, indicating that it plays a crucial role in protecting plants against methylation damage. AT2G22260 also exhibits similar properties to ALKBH2, and knock-out plants respond to methylmalonyl-CoA (MMS), a compound that is involved in the repair of 1-MEA. These findings suggest that AT2G22260 may also play a role in the repair of 1-MEA and the protection of plants against methylation damage.
