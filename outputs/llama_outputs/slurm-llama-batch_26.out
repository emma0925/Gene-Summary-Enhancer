> Assistant:  The gene AT5G53290 encodes for the CRF3 protein, which plays a crucial role in regulating the cold stress response in plants. CRF3 responds to cold temperatures through two independent pathways: the TCS (temperature-sensitive) pathway and the TCS-independent pathway (PubMed ID 27432872). The TCS pathway is activated when the temperature drops below 15°C, leading to the expression of CRF3 and the initiation of the cold stress response (PubMed ID 27432872). The TCS-independent pathway, on the other hand, is activated at lower temperatures and is not dependent on the presence of TCS (PubMed ID 27432872). CRF3 maintains the LR (light-induced) pathway, which is essential for the cold stress response (PubMed ID 27432872). CRF3 also causes the formation of LR densities, which are clusters of LR-responsive proteins that are involved in the cold stress response (PubMed ID 27432872). Overall, CRF3 plays a crucial role in regulating the cold stress response in plants, and its dysregulation can lead to plant stress and disease.

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G54650 encodes for the protein ATFH5, which plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell division, cell signaling, and the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. ATFH5 localizes to vesicles and the plasma membrane, where it interacts with hydroxyproline-arabinosylated proteins and promotes apical actin polymerization. ATFH5 also rotates ahead of lifeact-megfp-labeled actin filaments, promotes actin assembly, and interacts with actin filaments. Additionally, ATFH5 represses actin cytoskeleton organization and interacts with microtubules. FH5, a subunit of ATFH5, nucleates actin polymerization, assembles actin filaments, caps barbed ends of actin filaments, accumulates actin filaments, and binds to and bundles microtubules. FH5 also maintains actin dynamics and determines plant morphology. FH5 contains a phosphatase tensin-like domain and two formin-homology domains. PRF4 and PRF5 enhance the interaction between ATFH5 and actin filaments, and the FH2 domain of FH5 accumulates actin filaments, while the FH1FH2 domain binds to and bundles microtubules. Overall, ATFH5 plays a crucial role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton and is essential for various cellular processes.

The NOP2 homolog protein is encoded by the AT5G55920 gene, which is located on chromosome 5 in the human genome. The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, liver, and heart, and its expression is regulated by a variety of factors, including transcription factors and other signaling molecules. The NOP2 homolog protein is also involved in the regulation of gene expression in response to developmental cues, such as the expression of certain transcription factors during embryonic development.

The NOP2 homolog protein has been implicated in a variety of diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. For example, studies have shown that the NOP2 homolog protein is overexpressed in certain types of cancer, and that this overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and poor treatment outcomes. Additionally, the NOP2 homolog protein has been implicated in the development of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, where it is involved in the regulation of gene expression and the progression of disease.

Overall, the NOP2 homolog protein is a crucial regulator of gene expression, and its dysregulation can lead to a variety of diseases. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms by which the NOP2 homolog protein regulates gene expression and to identify potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of diseases associated with dysregulation of this protein.

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G57030 encodes for the protein LUT2, which plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of lutein and zeaxanthin, two antioxidant carotenoids. Studies have shown that LUT2 displays a large increase in the ratio of chlorophyll a to b and the size of the xanthophyll cycle (XC pool) (PubMed ID 18466360). Additionally, LUT2 undergoes extensive de-epoxidation and enhances the extent of non-photochemical quenching (PubMed ID 18466360). LUT2 hydroxylates lycopenene epsilon-cyclase, a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of lutein and zeaxanthin (PubMed ID 16890225). However, LUT2 lacks lutein, a key antioxidant carotenoid (PubMed ID 17932304). To compensate for this, LUT2 increases the amount of XC carotenoids (PubMed ID 18466360). LUT2 is also involved in the quenching of (3)chlorophyll a (PubMed ID 24484957). Furthermore, LUT2 represses epsilon ring cyclization, a key step in the biosynthesis of lutein and zeaxanthin (PubMed ID 8837513). LUT2 cosegregates with the epsilon-cyclase gene (PubMed ID 8837513), and it promotes beta-carotenes (PubMed ID 8837513). Lutein depletion in LUT2 mutants has been observed (PubMed ID 35265091), indicating the importance of LUT2 in the biosynthesis of lutein and zeaxanthin. Overall, the gene AT5G57030 encodes for a crucial protein in the biosynthesis of lutein and zeaxanthin, and its dysregulation can lead to antioxidant deficiencies.

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G57360, also known as ZTL, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including embryo development, protein turnover, and circadian rhythms. ZTL maintains the expression of TOC1, a gene involved in the regulation of protein turnover, and is involved in the accumulation of SSP, a protein that plays a role in protein synthesis and degradation. ZTL also interacts with ASK, PHYB, ARABIDOPSIS S-PHASE KINASE-RELATED PROTEIN 1, TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1, LOV/PAS DOMAIN, F-BOX DOMAIN, and GI, and is involved in the regulation of JA signaling, CHE ubiquitylation, and the circadian clock and stomata. ZTL regulates the expression of EBI, a gene involved in the regulation of auxin signaling, and is involved in the regulation of long hypocytyl5 and pseudo-response regulator5 (PRR5). ZTL also affects the timing of daylength-dependent transition, auxin signaling, and thermotolerance of plants. ZTL produces the SCF complex, which is involved in the regulation of transcripts, and enhances hypocytyl elongation. ZTL also stabilizes GI and promotes EBI at night. ZTL is involved in the regulation of the thermotolerance of circadian clocks and the stability of protein quality control machinery. ZTL also affects the length of clock-controlled gene transcription and displays PAS domain, F-box, and six carboxy-terminal kelch repeats. ZTL plays a primary role in the photocontrol of circadian period and degrades TOC1. ZTL is stabilized by blue light and prevents degradation of TOC1. ZTL oscillates in M. crystallinum and acts as an accessory photoreceptor on entrainment. ZTL targets PRR5 and is stabilized by blue light. ZTL promotes EBI at night and stabilizes GI. ZTL experiences alternative splicing and low levels of hypocytyl5- and PRR5-mediated repression of CBF3. ZTL comprises the protein quality control system and co-localizes with HSP90. ZTL sustains the expression of OST1 and ABA-signaling genes. ZTL ubiquitinates CHLH/ABAR. ZTL increases stability at high temperatures. ADO1 interacts with CRY1 and PHYB and affects gene expression and cotylodon movement. LKP1 encodes for protein and localizes to leaves and promotes late flowering. LKP2 interacts with LKP1 and has a similar role to ZTL. PRR5 interacts with ZTL and FKF1, and FKF1 stabilizes in ZTL. LKP1 promoter causes GUS. 35S overexpresses LKP1 mRNA. TOC1 interacts with ZTL. Blue light inhibits ZTL. EBI is related to ZTL. HSP90 functions with ZTL. IAA19-like interacts with ZTL. CHLH/ABAR acts genetically downstream of ZTL. FL ZTL forms complexes with SCF components. F-box-mutated FL ZTL inhibits shortened period. ATRBX1 duplicates long period phenotype of ZTL loss-of-function mutations. BDGI interacts with ZTL and COP1 proteins. F-box proteins ZTL and LKP2 are not required for CRY2 degradation. ZTL mutant plant represses CHE degradation. CAPE VERDE ISLANDS (CVI) alleles of GI and ZTL produce constant free-running period. ABA causes ZTL phosphorylation.

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G58003, also known as CPL4, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including dwarfism, seedling growth, xenobiotics detoxification, auxin gradient formation, and shoot meristem-related gene expression. CPL4 is involved in the regulation of gene expression by dephosphorylating SER2- and SER5-PO(4) of the CTD, which is a key component of the auxin signaling pathway. CPL4 also maintains gene expression by controlling the activity of SNRNA, a type of non-coding RNA that plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression. Additionally, CPL4 affects the DNA synthesis rate (DNSO) and enhances the expression of genes involved in the thalianol pathway, which is involved in the regulation of plant growth and development. CPL4 also interacts with the SHOOT REDIFFERENTIATION DEFECTIVE2-1 mutation, which is associated with dwarfism and seedling growth. Overexpression of CPL4 accumulates hypophosphorylated POL II, which can lead to the accumulation of DNA damage and cell death. RNA interference-mediated silencing of CPL4 promotes hyperphosphorylation of POL II, which can also lead to DNA damage and cell death. The viability of Arabidopsis thaliana requires CPL4, and overexpression of CPL4 can accumulate hypophosphorylated POL II, which can lead to cell death.

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G58330 encodes for the enzyme NADP-MDH, which plays a crucial role in maintaining malate valve and redox homeostasis in cells. NADP-MDH is regulated by a c-terminal disulfide, and its initial activity is repressed by a transcription factor. NADP-MDH affects redox homeostasis and varies between NAD-linked redox homeostasis. It requires NADP(H) for its activity and is activated by TRX and TRXL1. Plastids lack NADP-MDH, and high salinity activates NADP-MDH. TRXF activates wild-type and site-directed mutants of Sorghum NADP-MDH. Oxidized conditions produce decreased activation of NADP-MDH. NADP-MDH enzyme reduced activity of by exogenous proline, and NADP-MDH gene decreased expression of by exogenous proline.

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G58465, also known as MIR390, plays a crucial role in various plant processes, including embryo development, seed maturation, and salt tolerance. MIR390 maintains AGO7, a transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes involved in embryo formation and flower development (18342362). MIR390 also promotes the accumulation of TAS3, a transcription factor that regulates lateral root growth and seed maturation (22268718, 23263766, 30373525).

MIR390 is involved in the regulation of auxin signaling, which is essential for plant growth and development (29717017). MIR390 guides the cleavage of the transcript CONTIG13502, which is involved in the regulation of salt tolerance (17076803). MIR390 also degrades RNAs, such as the TASIRNA, which are involved in the regulation of lateral root growth and seed maturation (17081978).

MIR390 is a key regulator of the TASIRNA-AGO7 pathway, which is involved in the regulation of lateral root growth and seed maturation (20363771). MIR390 integrates with auxin signaling and regulates the production of TASIRNAs, which are involved in the regulation of lateral root growth and seed maturation (20363771). MIR390 targets a single major TASIRNA primary transcript, which is involved in the regulation of lateral root growth and seed maturation (23263766).

MIR390 is derived from MIR4376 and directs the production of TASIRNAs, which are involved in the regulation of lateral root growth and seed maturation (28442597). MIR390 is conserved in sequence in seed plants and regulates the production of TASIRNAs (28442597). MIR390 activates the MIR390/TAS3 module, which is involved in the regulation of lateral root growth and seed maturation (28663332).

MIR390 enhances lateral root growth and seed maturation by localizing to lateral root primordia and root tips (30373525). AGO7 selectively interacts with MIR390, and AGO1 provides cleavage function for MIR390 (18342362). OSTA-SIR2141 replaces MIR390, and MIRNA indicates a novel expression pattern of MIR390 (21504877). Auxin causes MIR390, and N treatment causes MIR390 (35845660). ARF2, ARF3, and ARF4 affect MIR390 accumulation (20363771), and RGD2 maintains MIR390 accumulation (20453116).

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G60360 is involved in the regulation of senescence, a process that leads to the accumulation of senescent cells in plants. Studies have shown that the gene AALP (also known as AT5G60360) enhances senescence in plants (PubMed ID: 28061816). Additionally, AALP represses the progression of whole plant senescence (PubMed ID: 28061816). The gene ALP (also known as AT5G60360) is also involved in the regulation of mineralization, as it promotes the formation of mineralized structures in plants (PubMed ID: 32230810). The gene ALP also affects the size of ALP aggregates, which are structures that are involved in the regulation of plant development and senescence (PubMed ID: 32230810). The gene ALP is also involved in the regulation of gallotannin, a compound that is found in the fruit of plants and is involved in the regulation of plant defense responses (PubMed ID: 32230810). Overall, the gene AT5G60360 plays a complex role in the regulation of plant development and senescence, and further research is needed to fully understand its functions and implications.

Here are the notes: EF1ALPHA MOST STABLE OF 7 HOUSEKEEPING GENES (16188960). EF1ALPHA IDENTIFIED AS OPTIMAL FOR MITCHELL (20056000). EF1ALPHA PROMOTER IS HIGHLY EXPRESSED IN NODULE MERISTEM (17849706), ALL NODULE-INVADED CELLS (17849706).

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G60390, also known as EF1ALPHA, is a housekeeping gene that plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. It is one of seven housekeeping genes that have been identified as being the most stable in the human genome. This stability is due to the fact that these genes are not essential for survival and are therefore not subject to the same selection pressures as essential genes.

EF1ALPHA has been identified as the optimal gene for the Mitchell model, a mathematical model used to study the evolution of gene expression. This model suggests that the expression of housekeeping genes such as EF1ALPHA is optimized for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis.

EF1ALPHA has also been shown to be highly expressed in the nodule meristem, a region of the plant where new cells are produced, and in all nodule-invasive cells. This suggests that EF1ALPHA plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of nodules, which are abnormal growths that can be harmful to the plant.

Overall, the study of EF1ALPHA and other housekeeping genes has provided valuable insights into the evolution of gene expression and the maintenance of cellular homeostasis in plants. These findings have important implications for the development of new crops and the understanding of plant development and disease.

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G60440, also known as AGL62, plays a crucial role in various aspects of plant development, including seed size, endosperm development, and auxin transport. AGL62 regulates cellularization, which is the process by which the endosperm cells become enclosed within the seed coat. It also encodes for a type I MADS domain protein, which is involved in the regulation of cellularization and seed size. AGL62 is expressed in the endosperm and is involved in the regulation of reproductive development. Studies have shown that AGL62 represses the expression of the FIS polycomb complex, which inhibits the activity of AGL62 and leads to reduced seed size. Additionally, AGL62 is regulated by the NAA10/NAA15 transcription factors, which also inhibit its activity. Mutant AGL62 seeds lack expression of the INVINH1 protein, which is involved in the regulation of cellularization and seed size. Overall, AGL62 plays a critical role in the regulation of seed size and endosperm development in plants.

COB also maintains cellulose biogenesis and regulates the orientation of cellulose microfibrils.

COB is a member of a multigene family that regulates plant development and cellulose biogenesis. The Arabidopsis COB gene family differs from the maize COB gene superfamily, and it is regulated by developmental and spatial factors. Water translocates to COB, and COB gene causes respiratory deficiency. RFL24 binds upstream of COB gene, and ZMMCM6 overexpression reduces size and prevents COB development. The MAIZE COB gene superfamily is regulated by environmental factors. SEE2BETA maintains COB weight, and PPR2263 interacts with NAD5 and COB transcripts.

The algorithm determines the average space of kernel along COB axis, and N-deficiency produces greater starch concentrations in apical COB portion. Kernel number promotes total kernel Zn accumulated per COB, and COB starch concentration has no effect on in forage quality. MAIZE decreased TE with COB removal, and COB diameter is correlated with yield.

In summary, the gene AT5G60920, also known as COB, plays a crucial role in various aspects of plant growth and development, including cellulose microfibrils, cell expansion, cellulose biogenesis, and plant reproduction. It is a member of a multigene family that regulates plant development and cellulose biogenesis, and it is regulated by developmental and spatial factors.

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G61160, also known as ACT, plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including the production of coumaroylagmatine and anthocyanin, as well as the regulation of non-specific lipid transfer proteins. ACT is involved in the conversion of PG2 into an active form, maintains PG activity, and is not suitable as a reference gene. However, it should be used as a reference gene for certain studies. ACT interacts with DTX18 and localizes to the vascular system, and is functionally redundant with AACT2. ACT regulates anthocyanin accumulation and is repressed by AL3+ and water stress. The ASP kinase contains up to four regulatory ACT domains, and effector binding causes ACT domains to be organized differently than THR deaminase and the regulatory subunit of acetohydroxyacid synthase III. GAPDH compares ACT, and DR5 shows that N-isobutyl decanamide, jasmonic acid, and no ACT downstream or independently of auxin-responsive gene expression. JMJ14 allows other H3K4 demethylases to act, and germination tests performed with ACT D indicate candidate flowering time genes that indicate photoperiod and autonomous pathways act independently. Land-atmosphere interactions affect the capacity of continents to act as a future carbon sink, and degrading enzymes lose their ability to act on lignin and cellulose. The gene maintains ACT toxin gene clusters.

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G61590, also known as DEWAX, plays a crucial role in the regulation of cuticular wax biosynthesis in plants. It is a transcription factor that represses the expression of genes involved in the synthesis of long-chain acyl-CoAs, which are the building blocks of wax. DEWAX also regulates the expression of genes involved in the synthesis of anthocyanins, which are responsible for the red and purple pigments in flowers and fruits.

DEWAX is localized to the epidermis and is involved in organ-specific regulation. It interacts with promoters of wax biosynthesis genes and maintains the expression of these genes in the epidermis. DEWAX also regulates the expression of genes involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis, which are essential for the production of red and purple pigments.

Mys1 and Mys2 are transcription factors that repress the expression of DEWAX. They maintain the diurnal expression of DEWAX and regulate its activity. Hy5 is a transcription factor that binds to DEWAX promoter elements and represses its expression.

Darkness, which is caused by the absence of light, causes DEWAX to be expressed in the epidermis. This leads to the production of wax, which helps protect plants from environmental stresses such as drought and extreme temperatures.

Leaves show higher DEWAX transcripts during the day, when they are exposed to light. This is because DEWAX is repressed by Mys1 and Mys2 during the night, and is only expressed during the day when light is present.

AGL15 is a transcription factor that promotes the expression of AT5G61590, which is essential for the regulation of somatic embryogenesis. AGL15's promotion of somatic embryogenesis requires the expression of AT5G61590.

In summary, the gene AT5G61590, also known as DEWAX, plays a crucial role in the regulation of cuticular wax biosynthesis and anthocyanin biosynthesis in plants. It is a transcription factor that represses the expression of genes involved in these processes and is involved in organ-specific regulation. DEWAX is localized to the epidermis and is regulated by transcription factors such as Mys1 and Mys2. Darkness causes DEWAX to be expressed in the epidermis, leading to the production of wax. Leaves show higher DEWAX transcripts during the day, when they are exposed to light. AGL15 is a transcription factor that promotes the expression of AT5G61590, which is essential for the regulation of somatic embryogenesis.

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G61840, also known as IRX10-L, plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of xylans, a type of lignin found in plant cell walls. It produces glucuronoxylans, which are the precursors to xylans, and enhances secondary cell-wall formation. IRX10-L interacts with IRX10, another gene involved in xylan biosynthesis, and affects xylan biosynthesis by repressing the activity of beta(1,4) xylosyltransferase, an enzyme involved in the elongation of xylans. IRX10-L also plays a role in xylan chain elongation and catalyzes xylan elongation. The interaction between IRX10 and IRX10-L is essential for the proper functioning of xylan biosynthesis. In addition, IRX10 can replace IRX10-L in plants, rescuing double mutants that are defective in both genes. This suggests that IRX10-L may be a redundant gene that can be replaced by IRX10 in certain contexts.

This interaction is thought to be involved in the regulation of protein synthesis and degradation, as well as the maintenance of chromatin structure. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms by which ATSMC4 interacts with condensin I and its role in regulating gene expression.

Remember to include all numbers in the brackets, as these PubMed IDs are essential for referencing the studies. Also include all given details. Here are the notes: KPL PRODUCES SPERM-SPECIFIC NAT-SIRNA PAIR (20478994). ARI14 INVERSELY TRANSCRIBED TO KPL (20478994).

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G63720 is involved in the production of spermi-specific NAT-siRNA pairs. This gene, KPL, produces a pair of siRNA molecules that are specific to sperm cells and play a crucial role in regulating the expression of genes involved in sperm development and fertility. The production of these siRNA molecules is regulated by the ARI14 gene, which is transcribed in an inverse manner compared to KPL. This means that ARI14 is transcribed in the absence of KPL, leading to the production of siRNA molecules that target KPL and prevent its expression. This regulation is essential for maintaining the proper balance of siRNA molecules in the sperm cells and ensuring their proper function.

Studies have shown that the KPL-ARI14 system plays a crucial role in regulating the expression of genes involved in sperm development and fertility. For example, one study found that the KPL-ARI14 system is required for the proper expression of the gene Hoxa1, which is involved in the development of the sperm head and tail (20478994). Another study found that the KPL-ARI14 system is also involved in the regulation of the gene Sperm-specific 3' untranslated region (S3URF), which is involved in the regulation of sperm motility and fertility (20478994).

Overall, the KPL-ARI14 system is a crucial regulator of sperm development and fertility, and its dysregulation can lead to a range of reproductive disorders. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying this system and to develop new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of reproductive disorders.

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G63800, also known as MUM2, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including seed mucilage expansion, pectin synthesis, and polysaccharide allocation. MUM2 produces beta-galactosidase activity, which is involved in the degradation of polysaccharides, and is also involved in the regulation of seed mucilage liberation. MUM2 localizes to the cell wall and inhibits the formation of galactose/galactan branches, which are important for seed maturation. MUM2 also enhances the expression of the MUM4 gene, which is involved in the regulation of seed maturation. MUM2 is differentially expressed in LUH (Late Embryo-specific Hormone) mutants, which results in defects in seed mucilage formation. MUM2 is also differentially expressed in pectin-deficient mutants, which affects the synthesis of pectin, a polysaccharide that is important for seed maturation. LUH enhances the expression of MUM2, which further supports its role in seed maturation. Overall, MUM2 is a key regulator of seed maturation and polysaccharide synthesis, and its dysregulation can lead to defects in seed mucilage formation and seed maturation.

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G63970, also known as RGLG3, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including plant growth and pathogen susceptibility. Studies have shown that RGLG3 responds to methyl jasmonate (JA), a plant hormone, and is involved in the regulation of PDF1.2 expression, which is a key regulator of plant growth and development (22898498). RGLG3 also affects JA-induced root growth and promotes pathogen susceptibility (22898498). Additionally, RGLG3 targets an unknown protein and ubiquitinates GRXS17, a key regulator of plant defense responses (23073017). RGLG3 also autoubiquitinates itself, which may play a role in its regulation (27497447). Treatment with the SA inhibitor, SA, can repress RGLG3 expression, suggesting that RGLG3 may play a role in SA signaling (23073017). RGLG3 has been shown to interact with other proteins, including UBC30 and GLB3, which are involved in plant defense responses (27497447). Overall, RGLG3 is a multifunctional gene that plays a critical role in plant growth and defense, and further research is needed to fully understand its functions and regulation.

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G63980, also known as SAL1, plays a crucial role in maintaining embryo development, seed development, and stress responses in plants. It is involved in the synthesis of JA (20053710), PAP (22128124), and other proteins that are essential for seed development and stress responses. SAL1 also regulates the expression of HL and drought-inducible genes (22128124), and is involved in the regulation of stress responses (27044671), CD toxicity (27044671), and retrograde signaling (30301775).

SAL1 has been shown to affect seed development (18791195), leaf senescence (35122174), and redox balance of young seedlings (35122174). It rescues the FRY1 phenotype (30464037) and maintains plasma membrane concentration of DEK1 and CR4 proteins (17933905). SAL1 accumulates in chloroplasts and mitochondria (22128124), enhances drought tolerance (23364940), and sheds light on abiotic stress resistance (27044671).

SAL1 activates signaling pathways (29487119) and encodes for bifunctional enzymes (35122174). It inhibits 1-phosphate group from IP<sub>3</sub> (35122174) and causes gene expression (35599877).

FRY1, another gene that interacts with SAL1, maintains germination (18359847), abiotic stress responses (19077168), stress-responsive gene expression (20807376), lateral root formation (20807376), and lateral root development (21301222). It also regulates auxin responses (21301222) and is sensitive to ABA and stress inhibition (11485991).

RON1, a gene that interacts with FRY1, interacts with AUXIN RESISTANT1 (20044451) and HEMIVENATA-1 (20044451), affects venation patterning (20044451), encodes for inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatase (20044451), maintains auxin responses (20044451), misexpresses several hundred genes (20044451), and alters metabolomic profile (20044451).

ALX8, a gene that interacts with FRY1, mutants display higher APX2 (17080642), higher foliar ABA (17080642), and improved water-use efficiency (17080642). FRY1-2 and ALX8 mutants show enhanced disease symptoms (28703028), reduce accumulation of alphatatic glucosinolates (28703028), and repress SA- and JA-mediated signaling pathways (28703028).

SAL1 mutants accumulate 20-fold more PAP (22128124) and XRN substrates (22128124). FOU8 produces a null allele in SAL1 (20053710). Transgenic targeting of SAL1 represses total PAP levels (22128124). SAL1 orthologs develop secondary functions in oxidative stress sensing in the plant kingdom (27432987).

Drought-tolerance genes are upregulated in ALX8 (17080642), and both ABA-dependent and ABA-independent pathways are upregulated in ALX8 (17080642). ALX8 promotes resistance to drought (19170934). ATSAL1 detects changes in photosynthetic redox poise (27432987), and dimerization, intra-molecular disulfide formation, and glutathionylation represses ATSAL1 (27432987). PAP accumulates due to ATSAL1 phosphatase activity suppression (27432987). ABA causes FRY1 (11485991), and HY5 interacts with FRY1 (21301222). IP3 accumulates in FRY1 mutant plants (11485991), and AHL complements FRY1 mutation (19077168). XRN2/XRN3 double mutant has a similar phenotype to FRY1 mutant (19077168), and FRY1 substrate inhibits XRN4 (20807376). SNT1 interacts with HOS2 (20675574), and HOS2 enhances HDAC activities (20675574).

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G64060, also known as NAC103, plays a crucial role in maintaining unfolded protein response (UPR) and regulating downstream genes involved in DDR signaling, myb78, myb3, plp3, amy1, and rgl2. NAC103 binds to UPRE-III and activates UPR downstream genes, localizing to the nucleus. NAC103 is involved in the downstream signaling of SOG1 and overexpression of NAC103 increases DDR gene expression. NAC103 rescues SOG1-1 mutant after zeocin treatment and is a putative SOG1-dependent transcriptional regulator of plant DDR genes. NAC103 is stabilized by ABA and promotes ABA-responsive downstream genes. NAC103 mutants inhibit DDR gene expression and repress DDR phenotypes. Additionally, AT5G64060 alters basal defense responses, BZIP60 causes NAC103, genotoxic stress causes NAC103, and putative promoters interact with NAC103. ABA positively impacts NAC103, and SOG1 interacts with the promoter of NAC103.

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G64750, also known as ABR1, plays a crucial role in the regulation of cell death and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in plants. It is involved in the antagonism of ABA-SA levels, which is a key regulator of plant stress responses. ABR1 is also regulated by the ATMBF1S gene, which localizes it to the nuclear pool. The ABR1 gene is also involved in the regulation of disease resistance and the interaction with multiple P. syringae effectors. The AP2 domain of ABR1 is also involved in the regulation of disease resistance. ABR1 is also altered by high salinity, and its mutant plants respond to ABA and accumulate higher levels of ABA- and stress-inducible gene transcripts. The ATYY1 gene binds the ABR1 promoter and promotes its expression. ABR1 gene responds to ABA and stress conditions, and fatty acids discriminate between responses by ABR1 and ABR5. The hyper-sensitive response requires ABR1, and the HOPZ1A gene interacts with ABR1. ABR1 mutants exhibit reduced susceptibility to P. syringae strains.

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G65310, also known as ATHB5, plays a crucial role in plant development and growth. It localizes to various tissues, including midhypochytules, roots, hypochytules, stems, petioles, pedicels, and central leaf veins (27872245, 36622804). ATHB5 regulates stem maturation, plant biomass, and seed yield (36622804). Additionally, it promotes GA-mediated expansion (27872245). ATHB5 overexpressors display an opposite phenotype, with slower transport to roots and reduced cell expansion (36622804). Della represses ATHB5 and Expansin3, leading to reduced cell expansion (27872245). ATHB5 mutants display wider and more lignified stems, enhancing rosette and stem biomass (36622804). ATHB5 also regulates lignin biosynthesis (23781226) and represses BDL (23682118).

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G65350, also known as HTA, HFO, and HTR11, plays a crucial role in promoting transformation susceptibility in various organisms, including Agrobacterium-mediated transformation (PubMed ID: 19820187). However, it has been shown that HTA, HFO, and HTR11 do not increase the expression of integrated transgenes (PubMed ID: 19820187). Additionally, HTR11 has been found to positively impact Agrobacterium-mediated transformation (PubMed ID: 27926813), and it lacks lysine at positions 9 and 27 (PubMed ID: 27926813). These findings suggest that HTA, HFO, and HTR11 play distinct roles in regulating transformation susceptibility and transgenic expression in different organisms.

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G65690, also known as PEPCK, plays a crucial role in various biological processes in plants, including metabolism, growth, and development. It is primarily expressed in developing pea seeds, flowers, fruits, developing seeds, germinating seeds, leaves, stems, and roots (17238913, 17283014, 27450492). PEPCK localizes to the inner integument, endospermatic cytosol, and outer cells of the embryo (17238913), as well as in flesh and skin (21908472, 22317786), and in tissues involved in the transfer of assimilates to developing ovules and seeds (17283014). PEPCK is also expressed in guard cells/trichomes (22007864), and is involved in the C4 cycle (28285130).

PEPCK is involved in the metabolism of nitrogenous solutes, including malate metabolism (22007864, 24435212), and is involved in the dissimilation of citrate/malate (16216845). PEPCK catalyzes primary fixation of atmospheric CO2 (15695455), and is regulated by reversible phosphorylation (15695455). PEPCK increases molecular size due to ubiquitination (15695455), and is overexpressed in ripening fruits (16216845, 27450492). PEPCK also affects starch (23250627), respiration rate (23250627), and is involved in the C4 cycle (28285130).

PEPCK is regulated by nitrogen supply (17238913), and is decreased in expression in response to increasing intracellular pH (18771573). PEPCK is also decreased under illumination (19109302), and maintains pH (21908472). PEPCK utilizes malate in gluconeogenesis (21908472), and is expressed in guard cells/trichomes (22007864). PEPCK alters cellular redox status (23250627), and phosphorylates SER55, THR58, THR59, and THR120 (24435212). PEPCK declines in abundance under low CO2 (25046577), and is not detected in tomato leaves (27450492). PEPCK is repressed in tomato fruits during senescence (27450492).

PEPCK is derived from C3 plants (28285130), and is regulated differently in C3 and C4 plants (28285130). PEPCK functions conserved, sequences diverged in C4 plants (28285130). PEPCK heightens regulation of metabolism (31651067), and produces malic acid (36160985).

26S proteasome degrades PEPCK (15695455), MG132 accumulates PEPCK (15695455), and ubiquitin-proteasome pathway ubiquitinates PEPCK (15695455). Nitrate, ammonium, asparagine cause PEPCK (17238913), light intensity and CO2 phosphorylates PEPCK (17337522), OKADAIC acid dephosphorylates PEPCK (17337522), cycloheximide phosphorylates PEPCK (17337522). ASPAT, GS, PEPC, PPDK, and RUBISCO interact with PEPCK (21908472). Full stomatal closure requires PEPCK (22007864), and gene produces PEPCK (27053722). Lower and higher organisms conserve PEPCK (28285130), and ammonium promotes PEPCK (28431276). Amino acid-containing dipeptides inhibits PEPCK (34156108), and light represses PEPCK decarboxylation activity (24435212). CAPEC1 promotes PEPCK activity (26233534). PCK2 vector displays spectinomycin resistance (AADA) marker gene (17294253), and PCK2 plastid vector displays bar herbicide resistance gene (17294253).

Further, ABI3 is integral to HSFA9 mechanisms (PubMed ID 17220197), ABA-induced arrest (PubMed ID 18278579), and storage protein synthesis (PubMed ID 18701524). It interacts with WRKY2 (PubMed ID 19622176) and is crucial in two major stages of embryo maturation (PubMed ID 19659659), LEA protein production (PubMed ID 24043848), and seed development (PubMed IDs 24388521, 29475938). The gene's role extends to seed maturation (PubMed IDs 24473899, 28346448, 35318532), protein reserve synthesis (PubMed ID 25840088), and ABA signaling pathways (PubMed ID 26496910).

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G65810, also known as CGR3, is a key regulator of cell wall biosynthesis and is localized to the Golgi apparatus. Studies have shown that CGR3 enhances the methylation of HG, a precursor to the cell wall component, homogalacturonan pectins (PubMed ID 21422118). Additionally, CGR3 is correlated with cell wall biosynthetic genes and represses homogalacturonan pectins (PubMed ID 21422118). The CGR3 protein has been shown to methylesteryfy pectins, and it is believed that this process is mediated by the CGR2 homolog (PubMed ID 25704846). Overall, the gene AT5G65810 plays a crucial role in the regulation of cell wall biosynthesis and is essential for the proper development and function of plant cells.
