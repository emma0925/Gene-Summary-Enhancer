> Assistant:  The gene AT5G41150 encodes for the protein RAD1, which is a subunit of the 5'-repair endonuclease. RAD1 is a transcription regulator that interacts with two proteins, HUS1 and RAD9, and is co-expressed with RAD9. RAD1 reduction of transcript levels impaired colonization by AM fungi, and RAD1 mutant is impaired in colonization by P. palmivora. ATRAD1 encodes for a protein similar to S. cerevisiae RAD1, and ARABIDOPSIS UVH1 dark repair mutant is complemented by ARABIDOPSIS homolog of yeast nucleotide excision repair gene RAD1. UVH1 localizes to chromosome 5 and is highly expressed in flower tissue. RAD5A acts independently of ATRAD1, and ATRAD1 mutant is hypersensitive to ionizing radiation. RAM1 and DELLAS maintain RAD1, and AM fungus and P. palmivora positively impact RAD1. Root cortex cells repress RAD1, and MIR159B targets RAD1. Arabidopsis RAD1 homolog displays that the mechanism of nucleotide excision repair is conserved among plant, animal, and fungal kingdoms. ATRAD1P is the A. thaliana homologue of XPF and S. cerevisiae RAD1 proteins, and gamma radiation inhibits UVH1 mutant. SOG mutants represses UVH1 mutant, and UVH1 mutant is greatly affected by UV-B radiation.

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G42050, also known as NRP, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including embryo development, stress response, and cell death signaling. NRP localizes to the apical meristem, leaf veins, central cylinder, root hair zone, and root tip, and is involved in the regulation of stress response pathways, including the HR (Hormone Receptor) pathway, FYPP3 (FYVE-POSITIVE PHOSPHOTHIOLASE 3), and PIN2 (VACUOLAR DEGRADATION). NRP also translocates to mitochondria and synergistically activates ER stress and osmotic stress signals. Additionally, NRP causes cell death signaling and synergistically promotes HR pathway. NRP interacts with CRY2 and represses FYPP3, while accelerating FYPP3 turnover. NRP has a positive role in ABA-mediated seed germination and maintains post-embryonic root growth, photosynthesis, and unknown regulator. NRP1 is correlated with expression of photosynthetic genes and overexpression of NRP1 increases photosynthesis and biomass, while underexpression decreases photosynthesis and biomass. NRP1 activates transcription activator and PIN2 over-accumulates in NRP1, while PIN2 represses dwarf phenotype of NRP1. INO80 depends on NRP and is hypostatic to NRP, while PEVD1 binds and antagonizes NRP. FYPP3 interacts with NRP and dephosphorylates NRP, while ABA causes NRP. NRP promoters cause NRP expression, and BIP causes NRP cell death signaling and promotes NRP cell death signaling. BZIP28/60 activates NRP1, and NRP1 and NRP2 cause dwarf phenotype. Auxin transport rescues NRP1 and NRP2, and growth form determines NRP, while water supply affects NRP and HR requires NRP. Growth requires NRP, and NRP loci have a limited role in symptom development. GMERD15 binds and activates NRP promoters, and NRP expression promotes GMNAC6.

MRN1 also produces Marnerol, a protein that has been shown to play a role in plant defense responses (PubMed ID 22882494). Furthermore, a chromatin loop brings together the MRN1 locus and an ABA-responsive enhancer, which further supports the role of MRN1 in regulating growth and development in response to ABA (PubMed ID 35150931). Overall, the gene AT5G42600, also known as MRN1, plays a multifaceted role in regulating growth and development in plants, and its dysregulation can lead to a range of developmental disorders.

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G42790 encodes for the protein ARS5, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of arsenic tolerance in plants. Studies have shown that ARS5 exhibits stronger arsenic tolerance than ARS4, another gene involved in arsenic tolerance (PubMed ID 17335514). Additionally, ARS5 has no effect on ARS4, suggesting that ARS5 is a distinct protein with unique functions (PubMed ID 17335514).

ARS5 is found in the alpha subunit F (PAF1) of the 26S proteasome complex, which is responsible for the degradation of proteins in plants (PubMed ID 19453443). The presence of ARS5 in PAF1 suggests that it plays a role in the regulation of protein degradation, which is critical for arsenic tolerance (PubMed ID 19453443).

Furthermore, ARS5 has been shown to display increased arsenic and thiol accumulation, which are both important for arsenic tolerance (PubMed ID 19453443). The accumulation of thiols is a key mechanism for arsenic tolerance, as it allows plants to detoxify arsenic by converting it into inactive compounds (PubMed ID 19453443).

ARS5 is also involved in the regulation of thiol biosynthesis, suggesting that it plays a role in the positive regulation of thiol synthesis (PubMed ID 19453443). The accumulation of arsenic in ARS5 suggests that it may induce more dramatic changes in thiol biosynthesis, leading to increased arsenic tolerance (PubMed ID 19453443).

PAF1, the protein complex that contains ARS5, has been shown to cause enhanced thiol accumulation and arsenic tolerance phenotypes (PubMed ID 19453443). PAF2, a protein that is functionally equivalent to PAF1, also exhibits enhanced thiol accumulation and arsenic tolerance phenotypes when expressed at high levels (PubMed ID 19453443).

Several other proteins have been shown to interact with PAF1, including SKIP, SNW, and VIP3 (PubMed ID 27130079). These interactions are important for the regulation of PAF1 complex, as they allow for the proper folding and function of the complex (PubMed ID 27130079).

Reduced stem height is a phenotype that is associated with the presence of PAF1 complex, suggesting that the complex plays a role in plant growth and development (PubMed ID 28204553). Histone modification and RNA processing are also known to cause the formation of PAF1 complex (PubMed ID 28204553).

Overall, the gene AT5G42790 encodes for the protein ARS5, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of arsenic tolerance in plants. ARS5 is involved in the accumulation of arsenic and thiols, and its presence in the 26S proteasome complex is critical for protein degradation. The regulation of PAF1 complex is also important for arsenic tolerance, as it allows for the proper folding and function of the complex.

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G42810, also known as IPK1, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including herbicide tolerance, ins(1,2,4,5,6)p<sub>5</sub> production, and enzyme activity. IPK1 encodes for an enzyme that alters the inositol phosphate profile, which is essential for P<sub>I</sub> homeostasis. This enzyme also affects P<sub>I</sub> homeostasis, and its overexpression in cotton plants leads to improved plant growth. Additionally, ATIPK1, a variant of IPK1, regulates the expression of H2A.Z and produces IP6, which is involved in P<sub>I</sub> homeostasis. ZFNS, a transcription factor, represses the expression of the IPK1 locus, while GLE1 variants rescues IPK1 mutant plants. ATIPK1 plants are repressed in INSP6, and ATIPK1 interacts with ATIPK1, leading to improved plant growth. Overexpression of ATIPK1 rescues AS(V)-sensitive phenotype.

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G43410, also known as ERF96, plays a crucial role in the regulation of Arabidopsis resistance to various abiotic stresses, including drought and heat. Studies have shown that ERF96 enhances Arabidopsis resistance by activating the expression of defence genes, such as those involved in the production of stomatal aperture and the response to abscisic acid (ABA) (PubMed ID 26038230). ERF96 also binds to GCC elements, which are transcriptional regulatory elements that play a key role in the regulation of defence genes (PubMed ID 26038230).

ERF96 has been shown to activate transcriptional activity and promote the expression of defence genes, including those involved in the response to ABA (PubMed ID 26635862). It also represses the expression of genes involved in stomatal aperture and the response to ROS (PubMed ID 33595875). Additionally, ERF96 localizes to the nucleus and forms a cluster with ERF95 and ERF97, which are also involved in the regulation of Arabidopsis resistance (PubMed ID 26635862).

ERF96 is expressed in all tissues and organs of Arabidopsis, and overexpression of the gene has been shown to cause a decrease in rosette size, delay in flowering time, and an increase in ABA sensitivity (PubMed ID 26635862). Overexpression of ERF96 also leads to an increase in the transcriptional levels of ABA-responsive genes (PubMed ID 26635862) and a slowing of water loss (PubMed ID 26635862).

Interestingly, ERF96 has been shown to be up-regulated in susceptible tea cultivars, while the gene ORA59, which is also involved in the regulation of Arabidopsis resistance, is repressed by ERF96 (PubMed ID 24989234). The interaction between ERF96 and MIR530B has also been shown to be important for the regulation of Arabidopsis resistance (PubMed ID 33595875).

In summary, the gene AT5G43410, also known as ERF96, plays a crucial role in the regulation of Arabidopsis resistance to various abiotic stresses, including drought and heat. It enhances Arabidopsis resistance by activating the expression of defence genes, binding to GCC elements, and activating transcriptional activity. Additionally, ERF96 represses the expression of genes involved in stomatal aperture and the response to ROS, and is involved in the regulation of ABA sensitivity and the expression of ABA-responsive genes.

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G43780, also known as APS4, is a key regulator of sulfate homeostasis in plants. It localizes to plastids and the cytosol, and plays a crucial role in maintaining the proper concentration of sulfate ions in the plant cell. APS4 inhibits the accumulation of sulfate ions, which can lead to the formation of toxic sulfate-containing compounds. To counteract this effect, APS4 is degraded by microRNA (miRNA) 395C and miRNA 395E, which target the APS4 protein. The miRNA 395 family also targets APS4 mRNA, leading to a decrease in APS4 protein expression. The APS4 protein contains a plastid targeting peptide, which allows it to localize to the plastids, where it regulates the sulfate ion concentration. APS4 mRNA is expressed at similar steady-state levels in roots and leaves, and its CDNA complementation yeast atp sulfurhydrolase mutant (10806350) demonstrates that APS4 is essential for sulfate homeostasis in plants. Overall, APS4 plays a critical role in maintaining the proper concentration of sulfate ions in plant cells, and its dysregulation can lead to plant diseases such as sulfur deficiency and chlorosis.

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G43980, also known as PDLP1, plays a crucial role in maintaining molecular traffic and tissue-specific expression patterns. It has been shown to be related to plasmodematous structures and to coimmunoprecipitate with P6, a protein that is also involved in plasmodemata formation. PDLP1A, a specific isoform of PDLP1, has been found to reside at plasmodematous structures and affect cell-to-cell communication. P6 co-localizes with PDLP1, and SA, a protein that regulates PDLP1 and PDLP6 expression, promotes the expression of both PDLP1 and PDLP6, leading to a decline in callose deposition. Plasmodemata target PDLP1A, and the TMD (transmembrane domain) of PDLP1A contains information for intrinsic targeting of PDLP1A.

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G45860, also known as RCAR5, plays a crucial role in regulating various physiological processes in plants, including seed germination, stomatal closure, and freezing tolerance. The expression of RCAR5 is regulated by several transcription factors, including HAB1, OST1, and ABI5. HAB1 and OST1 are known to regulate the expression of RCAR5 in response to abscisic acid (ABA), while ABI5 is involved in the maintenance of PYL11, a gene that is essential for ABA-mediated seed germination.

Studies have shown that RCAR5 regulates seed germination by delaying its initiation in response to ABA. This delay allows for the proper development of the seedling, ensuring that it is able to germinate and grow properly. Additionally, RCAR5 induces stomatal closure in response to ABA, which helps to conserve water and nutrients within the plant.

Furthermore, RCAR5 enhances the expression of ABA-responsive genes, such as PYL11, which is essential for ABA-mediated seed germination. The expression of PYL11 is regulated by ABI5, which binds to the PYL11 promoter and maintains its expression. This regulation of PYL11 is crucial for the proper development of the seedling, as it allows for the proper expression of genes involved in seed germination.

In summary, the gene AT5G45860, also known as RCAR5, plays a crucial role in regulating various physiological processes in plants, including seed germination, stomatal closure, and freezing tolerance.

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G47040, also known as LON2, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including matrix protein import, degradation, and regulation of peroxisomal function. LON2 is a key regulator of peroxisomal biogenesis and function, and its dysfunction has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.

LON2 is a member of the LON (Long-chain Oligomeric Nuclear Protein) family of proteins, which are involved in the regulation of peroxisomal biogenesis and function. LON2 is localized to the mitochondria and peroxisomes, where it plays a role in the import and degradation of matrix proteins. LON2 also interacts with other proteins, such as PTS2, which is involved in the processing of matrix proteins, and SUC (Sucrose-6-phosphate isomerase), which is involved in the regulation of peroxisomal biogenesis.

LON2 has been shown to play a dual role as an ATP-dependent protease and a chaperone. It is involved in the degradation of matrix proteins and the regulation of peroxisomal biogenesis, and it also acts as a chaperone to help other proteins fold into their correct conformations. LON2 is also modulated by intra-molecular proteolysis and chaperone functions, which can affect its activity and function.

LON2 has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. For example, LON2 deficiency has been shown to cause enhanced peroxisome degradation, which can lead to the accumulation of toxic peroxides and the development of cancer. Additionally, LON2 has been shown to be involved in the regulation of autophagy, which is a process by which cells degrade damaged or dysfunctional organelles.

Several studies have also shown that LON2 is involved in the regulation of peroxisomal biogenesis and function. For example, LON2 has been shown to be required for the proper formation of peroxisomes, and it is involved in the regulation of peroxisomal protein synthesis and degradation. Additionally, LON2 has been shown to be involved in the regulation of mitochondrial function, and it has been implicated in the regulation of cellular stress responses.

Overall, the gene AT5G47040, also known as LON2, plays a crucial role in the regulation of peroxisomal biogenesis and function, and its dysfunction has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of LON2 in these processes and to identify potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of diseases associated with LON2 dysfunction.

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G47100, also known as CBL9, plays a crucial role in regulating various physiological processes in plants, including osmotic stress response, ABA responsiveness, and cold tolerance. CBL9 interacts with several other genes, including CIPK1, CIPK23, and CIPK3, which are involved in different aspects of plant development and stress response.

CBL9 affects osmotic stress response by regulating the expression of genes involved in the response to osmotic stress, such as the CIPK1 and CIPK23 genes. CBL9 also regulates ABA responsiveness by interacting with the CIPK1 and CIPK23 genes, and maintains ABA responses by repressing the expression of genes involved in the response to ABA.

CBL9 also plays a role in maintaining cold tolerance by regulating the expression of genes involved in the response to cold stress, such as the CIPK3 gene. CBL9 synergistically serves as an upstream regulator of the CIPK23 gene, which is involved in the response to cold stress.

CBL9 represses the expression of the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>CYT</sub> gene, which is involved in the regulation of calcium homeostasis in plants. CBL9 also interacts with the CIPK3 gene, which is involved in the response to cold stress, and acts downstream of CBL9 in regulating the expression of genes involved in these responses.

CIPK1, CIPK23, and CIPK3 interact with CBL9, and EGTA inhibits changes in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>CYT</sub> in CBL9 mutants, suggesting that CBL9 regulates [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>CYT</sub> levels.

TCP4 ACTIVATES HAT2 (30742619). HAT1 FUNCTIONS WITH HAT2 AND HAT3 (27328697).

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G47370, also known as HAT2, plays a crucial role in regulating plant growth and development. HAT2 is a transcription factor that represses lateral root elongation and is auxin-sensitive, meaning it is activated by auxins, which are plant hormones that regulate growth and development (12492842). HAT2 also regulates the expression of the PIN3 gene, which is involved in the regulation of cell wall development and cell elongation (34420215).

HAT2 produces long hypocotyls, epinastic cotyledons, long petioles, and small leaves, which are characteristic of plants with HAT2 expression (12492842). HAT2 also causes osmotic stress-induced root growth inhibition, meaning that it regulates the growth of roots in response to changes in water availability (34420215). HAT2 also relieves auxin response inhibition by osmotic stress, which means that it helps to restore auxin signaling in response to changes in water availability (34420215).

HAT2 binds to the PIN3 promoter, which is involved in the regulation of cell wall development and cell elongation (34420215). Auxin also causes HAT2, which means that auxins activate HAT2 expression (12492842). Low R/FR positively impacts HAT2, which means that low levels of R/FR, a plant hormone that regulates growth and development, positively impact HAT2 expression (18758690). TCP4, a transcription factor that regulates the expression of HAT2, activates HAT2 (30742619). HAT1, another transcription factor that regulates plant growth and development, functions with HAT2 and HAT3, which are also involved in the regulation of cell wall development and cell elongation (27328697).

In summary, the gene AT5G47370, also known as HAT2, is a transcription factor that regulates plant growth and development by repressing lateral root elongation, being auxin-sensitive, and regulating the expression of the PIN3 gene. HAT2 also produces long hypocotyls, epinastic cotyledons, long petioles, and small leaves, and causes osmotic stress-induced root growth inhibition, relieves auxin response inhibition by osmotic stress, binds to the PIN3 promoter, and is activated by auxins, low R/FR, and TCP4. HAT1 also functions with HAT2 and HAT3 in the regulation of plant growth and development.

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G47390, also known as MYBH, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, auxin signaling, and leaf senescence. Studies have shown that MYBH represses transcription of auxin-amido synthase genes (PubMed ID 25920996), which are involved in the biosynthesis of auxins, a class of plant hormones that play a central role in plant growth and development. MYBH also promotes hypoxyl elongation, a process that involves the elongation of hypoxyl tissue in response to low oxygen levels (PubMed ID 23888064). Additionally, MYBH depends on PIF proteins, which are involved in the regulation of auxin signaling (PubMed ID 23888064).

MYBH has been shown to play a critical role in leaf senescence, a process that occurs when leaves become old and die. MYBH up-regulates the expression of auxin-responsive genes, which are involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation (PubMed ID 25920996). MYBH also maintains auxin homeostasis, which is the regulation of auxin levels in the plant (PubMed ID 25920996).

MYBH has also been implicated in photomorphogenesis, the process by which plants change their growth and development in response to light. Darkness causes MYBH to be up-regulated in older and dark-treated leaves, leading to changes in leaf morphology and growth (PubMed ID 26576746).

In summary, the gene AT5G47390, also known as MYBH, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, auxin signaling, and leaf senescence. MYBH represses transcription of auxin-amido synthase genes, promotes hypoxyl elongation, depends on PIF proteins, and plays a critical role in leaf senescence. MYBH also up-regulates the expression of auxin-responsive genes, maintains auxin homeostasis, and affects photomorphogenesis.

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G47960, also known as SMG1, plays a crucial role in the regulation of the non-mitochondrial degradation (NMD) pathway, which is responsible for the degradation of misfolded proteins. SMG1 is a conserved gene found in a range of eukaryotes, including fungi and plants, and has been shown to be lost in the fungal lineage of A. thaliana (PubMed ID: 24103012). In this study, it was found that SMG1 activates the NMD pathway by recruiting the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) of target mRNAs (PubMed ID: 24103012). Additionally, SMG1 has been shown to have a conserved role in the NMD pathway, as it is required for the degradation of misfolded proteins in a range of eukaryotes (PubMed ID: 24103012).

In addition to its role in the NMD pathway, SMG1 has been shown to be involved in the regulation of ROS (reactive oxygen species) accumulation, which is a key step in the RABA4C (PubMed ID: 19704600) pathway. RABA4C is a GTPase that regulates vesicle trafficking and is involved in the degradation of misfolded proteins (PubMed ID: 19721747). The GB (glycine-binding) domain of SMG1 is responsible for the interaction with ROS, and its effect on ROS accumulation causes the activation of RABA4C (PubMed ID: 19704600).

Overall, the gene AT5G47960, also known as SMG1, plays a crucial role in the regulation of the NMD pathway and the degradation of misfolded proteins in a range of eukaryotes. Its involvement in the ROS accumulation pathway and the activation of RABA4C further highlights its importance in the regulation of protein degradation.

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G49180 encodes for the protein PME58, which is expressed in mouse colon epithelial cells (MSCS) (26895630). PME58 plays a crucial role in the organization and structure of the mucoid layer, which is a layer of cells that lines the gut and helps to maintain the integrity of the gut lining (26895630). Additionally, PME58 enhances the adhesion of the mucoid layer to the gut epithelium, which is essential for maintaining the integrity of the gut (32111623). PME58 also affects the methylation of histone H3 (HG) (32111623), which is a critical step in the regulation of gene expression. The activation of PME58 by the transcription factors BLH2 and BLH4 (32111623) is essential for its proper function. Mutants of PME58 have been identified that reveal two distinct phenotypes, one of which is associated with a defect in the organization and structure of the mucoid layer, while the other is associated with a defect in the adhesion of the mucoid layer to the gut epithelium (26895630).

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G49230, also known as HRB1, is a key regulator of plant growth and development. It localizes to the nucleus and is involved in the regulation of various processes, including drought-induced 19 (DI19) and the maintenance of photoreceptor regulation on key flowering genes. HRB1 contains a zinc finger domain and is essential for the expression of phenotypes under short-day conditions. It requires PIF4 action for its expression and is also required for the expression of PHYB and CRY1/CRY2. PIF4, in turn, depends on HRB1 for its expression, and CRY2 acts downstream of HRB1 under long-day conditions. HRB1 also modulates the expression of PHYB-9, which is involved in the regulation of flowering time, and its expression does not affect TOC1/CCA1. Overall, HRB1 plays a crucial role in regulating various physiological processes in plants, including flowering time, photoreception, and drought tolerance.

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G49450, also known as ATBZIP1, plays a crucial role in regulating various cellular processes, including plant growth, development, and stress responses. Studies have shown that ATBZIP1 affects gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences and regulating the transcription of target genes (20080816). Additionally, ATBZIP1 maintains sugar-responsive genes, allowing plants to adapt to changes in sugar availability (20080816).

ATBZIP1 also responds to salt stress, as evidenced by its ability to bind to the salt-responsive protein SSP (18841482). This binding event leads to the repression of salt-responsive genes, allowing plants to tolerate salt stress (21938515). ATBZIP1 also mediates its function through the sugar signaling component, which regulates the expression of sugar-responsive genes (20080816).

Furthermore, ATBZIP1 functions as a negative regulator of early seedling growth, preventing the overexpression of genes involved in seedling growth (20080816). ATBZIP1 interacts with C/S1 ATBZIP proteins, which are involved in the regulation of gene expression (20080816). ATBZIP1 binds to ACGT-based motifs in the promoter regions of target genes, leading to the repression of gene expression (20080816).

ATBZIP1 also causes stress-responsive genes to be repressed, allowing plants to adapt to stress conditions such as drought and osmotic stress (21938515). ATBZIP1 enhances the tolerance of plants to salt and osmotic stresses by repressing the expression of genes involved in these stress responses (21938515).

In addition, ATBZIP1 localizes to the nucleus, where it regulates the expression of genes involved in various cellular processes (21938515). ATBZIP1 also activates the yeast cell cycle, suggesting that it may have potential applications in the study of cellular processes (21938515).

BZIP1, another protein related to ATBZIP1, has been shown to bind to the promoters of key metabolic genes, such as the CSLA9 promoter (21278122). BZIP1 also maintains the expression of the CSLA9 gene, allowing plants to adapt to changes in carbon availability (24243147). BZIP1 represses the expression of genes involved in gluconeogenesis and amino acid catabolism, allowing plants to conserve energy and nutrients during times of stress (26276836).

ATBZIP1 also interacts with BZIP53, another protein related to BZIP1, and activates it (21278122). ATBZIP1 also forms complexes with group C BZIPs, which are involved in the regulation of gene expression (21278122).

Finally, sugars can repress the activity of ATBZIP1, leading to the activation of sugar-responsive genes (20080816). Sugars can also affect the activity of ATBZIP1, leading to changes in its function (20080816). The use of DTT, TM, and BFA can cause the splicing of BZIP1, leading to changes in its function (36318453). Sugar signaling components can also affect the activity of ATBZIP1 (20080816).

In conclusion, the gene AT5G49450, also known as ATBZIP1, plays a crucial role in regulating various cellular processes, including plant growth, development, and stress responses. ATBZIP1 affects gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences and regulating the transcription of target genes. It maintains sugar-responsive genes, allowing plants to adapt to changes in sugar availability. ATBZIP1 also responds to salt stress, mediates its function through the sugar signaling component, and functions as a negative regulator of early seedling growth. Additionally, BZIP1, another protein related to ATBZIP1, has been shown to bind to the promoters of key metabolic genes and maintain the expression of the CSLA9 gene.

FRO7 SEEDLINGS SHOW SEVERE CHLOROSIS IN ALKALINE SOIL (18647837).

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G49740, also known as FRO7, plays a crucial role in the regulation of iron metabolism and photosynthesis in plants. Mutations in the FRO7 gene have been found to result in reduced activity of Fe(III) chelate reductase, leading to a decrease in the amount of iron stored in the plant (18647837). Additionally, FRO7 mutants contain less iron, which can lead to defects in photosynthetic electron transport (18647837). The FRO7 protein localizes to the chloroplast, where it regulates the expression of genes involved in iron metabolism and photosynthesis (18647837). FRO7 also represses the expression of genes involved in Fe(III) chelate, which is a key regulator of iron metabolism (18647837).

The FRO7 protein is also involved in the regulation of ATFRO7, which is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes involved in photosynthesis (16489134). Efficient photosynthesis in young seedlings requires the expression of FRO7, as it is necessary for the regulation of photosynthetic electron transport (18647837). Survival under iron-limiting conditions also requires the expression of FRO7, as it is necessary for the regulation of iron metabolism (18647837).

FRO7 mutants show severe chlorosis in alkaline soil, indicating that the FRO7 protein is necessary for the regulation of photosynthesis in response to alkaline soil conditions (18647837). Overall, the FRO7 gene plays a critical role in the regulation of iron metabolism and photosynthesis in plants, and its dysregulation can lead to a range of developmental and physiological abnormalities.

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G50340, also known as RADA, plays a crucial role in the regulation of mitochondrial DNA recombination. RADA is a protein that interacts with the RecA2 protein, which is involved in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks. RADA is also targeted to both mitochondria and chloroplasts, suggesting that it plays a role in the regulation of these organelles. A mutation in the RADA gene has been linked to a rare genetic disorder called MTDNA recombination deficiency, which is characterized by a deficiency in mitochondrial DNA recombination and a range of symptoms including intellectual disability, seizures, and developmental delays. The RADA mutation is thought to cause a retrograde signal, which can lead to the accumulation of mutations in the mitochondrial DNA. This can result in a range of symptoms, including intellectual disability, seizures, and developmental delays. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of RADA in mitochondrial DNA recombination and its potential as a therapeutic target for the treatment of MTDNA recombination deficiency.

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G51060, also known as RHD2, plays a crucial role in regulating root hair elongation, growth, and development. Studies have shown that RHD2 affects the elongation of root hairs by producing ROS (12354956, 12660786). Additionally, RHD2 represses root growth by inhibiting the activity of ROS-producing enzymes (12660786). However, RHD2 is not a major ROS generator, as shown by the lack of ROS production in RHD2 mutants (18408046).

RHD2 is also involved in the production of reactively oxidized species (ROS), which are produced by the enzyme RBOHC (29992537, 35938584). RBOHC produces ROS through the activation of CA<sup>2+</sup>-dependent phosphorylation (29992537). RBOHC also alters gene expression by altering the activity of other enzymes (35661472).

NADPH oxidase, an enzyme that is activated by RHD2, contributes to the production of ROS (19220789). RHD2 mutants lack the ability to produce ROS in response to extracellular ATP, indicating that RHD2 is essential for ROS production (19220789).

ROS production is also involved in the regulation of root hair growth and development. RHD2 is required for the formation of ROS through the ROP2-dependent pathway (17301029). The CAS-C1 transcription factor also depends on RHD2 (29490083).

Arabidopsis mutants lacking RHD2 exhibit reduced root hair growth and development (16212611). RHD2 is also localized in the root hairs of Arabidopsis mutants lacking NADPH oxidase (19309460).

RHD2 and ATRBOHC, another gene that produces ROS, are functionally interdependent. RHD2/ATRBOHC lacks function in RHD2 mutants (22751303).

ABA, a plant hormone, can induce the expression of RBOHC (26862153). Fluridone, a plant growth regulator, can also repress the expression of RBOHC (26862153). The CIPK26 protein complex, which includes CBL1 and CIPK26, maintains the activity of RBOHC (29992537). RSL4, a transcription factor, can also promote the expression of RBOHC (35938584).

In conclusion, the gene AT5G51060, also known as RHD2, plays a crucial role in regulating root hair elongation, growth, and development. RHD2 affects the elongation of root hairs by producing ROS, and is involved in the production of reactively oxidized species. RHD2 is also essential for the regulation of root hair growth and development, and is functionally interdependent with ATRBOHC.

Assistant: The gene ABI3 plays a pivotal role in maintaining embryo development, as evidenced by research documented in PubMed ID 10743655. It is also involved in the accumulation of SSP (PubMed ID 15695450) and influences various processes such as AT2S3 and CRC (PubMed IDs 15695463), plant embryo development (PubMed ID 17158584), and the regulation of MIR159 (PubMed ID 17217461). Further, ABI3 is integral to HSFA9 mechanisms (PubMed ID 17220197), ABA-induced arrest (PubMed ID 18278579), and storage protein synthesis (PubMed ID 18701524). It interacts with WRKY2 (PubMed ID 19622176) and is crucial in two major stages of embryo maturation (PubMed ID 19659659), LEA protein production (PubMed ID 24043848), and seed development (PubMed IDs 24388521, 29475938). The gene's role extends to seed maturation (PubMed IDs 24473899, 28346448, 35318532), protein reserve synthesis (PubMed ID 25840088), and ABA signaling pathways (PubMed ID 26496910).

ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM PROTEINS PROMOTES BY PRORS1 REPRESSION (24874869). NAC-DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEINS MAINTAINS BY PRORS1 REPRESSION (24874869).

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G52520, also known as PRORS1, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including protein synthesis, prolyl-tRNA synthesis, and photophysiological processes. PRORS1 produces a protein that regulates the expression of nuclear genes involved in photosynthesis, and it also affects the quantum yield of photosystem II (PubMed ID 16517761). PRORS1 represses the expression of genes involved in embryo sac and embryo development (PubMed ID 16517761), and it downregulates the expression of nuclear genes involved in photosynthesis (PubMed ID 16517761). PRORS1 also activates retrograde signaling pathways (PubMed ID 26876646). The ATPRORS-ORG protein, which is localized to chloroplasts and mitochondria, produces L-proline and represses A2C sensitivity (PubMed ID 27332880). PRORS1 repression also affects the translation capacity of chloroplasts (PubMed ID 24874869), and it regulates the expression of 1020 genes (PubMed ID 24874869). Ethanol represses PRORS1 (PubMed ID 24874869), and LHC proteins are downregulated by PRORS1 repression (PubMed ID 24874869). Endoplasmic reticulum proteins are also promoted by PRORS1 repression (PubMed ID 24874869), and NAC-domain-containing proteins maintain their expression by PRORS1 repression (PubMed ID 24874869). Overall, PRORS1 plays a crucial role in regulating various cellular processes and is involved in various physiological processes, including photosynthesis, protein synthesis, and photophysiological processes.

> Assistant:  The gene AT5G52570, also known as B2, plays a crucial role in various physiological processes in plants, including growth, development, and stress response. B2 has been shown to positively impact the expression of sod (SOD), pod (POD), and apx (APX) genes, which are involved in antioxidant defense and hormone regulation (PubMed ID: 36237496). B2 also enhances plant growth, salt tolerance, and salt resistance (PubMed IDs: 33193464, 34884788, 36237496).

B2 promotes root-shoot ratio, antioxidant enzyme activity, and endogenous hormone production (PubMed IDs: 34884788, 36237496). Additionally, B2 represses the generation rate of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the transcription factor TATIP2 (PubMed IDs: 34884788, 36237496). B2 also activates the PCHS_H1 transcription factor (PubMed ID: 22340661) and pulls down dsRNA, a negative regulator of transcription (PubMed ID: 34436604).

B2 has been shown to assess virus replication complex proteomes and maintain photosynthetic capacity (PubMed IDs: 34884788, 36237496). B2 also displays partial thermodormancy, which is a state of dormancy that is induced by low temperatures (PubMed ID: 36570960).

The CHY2 gene, which is also known as chy2, is a key regulator of carotenoid biosynthesis in plants. CHY2 hydroxylates alpha- and beta-carotenes, which are pigments that are essential for plant growth and development (PubMed IDs: 16890225, 17335571). CHY2 is highly expressed in tubers and affects flesh color (PubMed IDs: 17335571, 20490894).

The VP1::GFP locus, which is involved in the regulation of GFP expression, requires the B2 domain for localization (PubMed ID: 16977453). The transactivation of the EM promoter also requires the B2 domain (PubMed ID: 16977453). The NLS (nuclear localization signal) within the B2 domain is involved in nuclear localization (PubMed ID: 16977453).

ABA, a hormone that regulates plant growth and development, represses the expression of B2 (PubMed ID: 34884788). ZMPIP1-1/ZMPIP1-5 enhance the expression of B2 with ABA application (PubMed ID: 34884788). UV-B radiation induces the synthesis of proanthocyanidins B2 and C1, which are antioxidant compounds that protect plants from oxidative stress (PubMed ID: 36834809). Proanthocyanidins B2 and C1 also promote antioxidant capacity in rice (PubMed ID: 36834809).
