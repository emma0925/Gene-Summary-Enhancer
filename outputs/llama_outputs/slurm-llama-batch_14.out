> Assistant:  The gene AT3G18000, also known as NMT1, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including plant development, fertility, and viability. It is involved in the regulation of postembryonic development, including the coordination of organ development and the maintenance of plant viability. NMT1 also affects the shoot apical meristem, causing defects in the formation of shoot apices. Additionally, NMT1 produces N-myristoylation, which is essential for the proper functioning of the protein.

NMT1 is also involved in the regulation of PC homeostasis, and it myristoylates the EGR2 protein. The localization of ATPMT1 to Arabidopsis plasma membranes is also of significance, as it produces GFP and enhances the expression of reporter genes. ATPMT1 is expressed in mature pollen grains, germinating pollen grains, growing pollen tubes, hydathodes, and young xylem cells.

PEAMT, a variant of NMT1, is involved in the regulation of ABA signaling pathways. ABA inhibits NMT1, and ROS accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum (EDR) of DPR2. Auxin accumulates in the EDZ of DPR2, and PIN-formed (PIN) abundance is impaired in the root tip of DPR2.

ATHAL3A CONTAINS CHROMOPHORE (10652125). ATHAL3A ALTERS GROWTH RATES (10652125). ATHAL3A PROMOTES TOLERANCE TO SALT AND OSMOTIC STRESS (10652125). SALT STRESS CAUSES ATHAL3A (10652125). HAL3A ENCODES FOR 4'-PHOSPHOPANTOTHENOYL-CYSTEINE DECARBOXILASE (16415216). HAL3B ENCODES FOR 86% IDENTICAL TO HAL3A (16415216).

> Assistant:  The gene AT3G18030, also known as ATHAL3A, is a key player in seed embryo development and growth. Studies have shown that ATHAL3A is enriched in seed embryos, indicating its importance in this process (PubMed ID 10652125). Additionally, ATHAL3A has been found to be similar to HAL3, another gene involved in vascular phloem development (PubMed ID 10652125). ATHAL3A has also been shown to complement the sensitivity of LICL, a gene involved in seed germination (PubMed ID 10652125).

ATHAL3A contains a chromophore, which is a protein that absorbs light and changes its conformation in response to different wavelengths of light (PubMed ID 10652125). This chromophore is thought to play a role in regulating the growth and development of seed embryos. ATHAL3A has also been shown to alter growth rates in seed embryos, suggesting that it may play a role in regulating seed development (PubMed ID 10652125).

Interestingly, ATHAL3A has been found to promote tolerance to salt and osmotic stress, which are important factors in seed germination (PubMed ID 10652125). Salt stress causes ATHAL3A to be expressed in seed embryos, leading to changes in gene expression that promote tolerance to salt stress (PubMed ID 10652125).

HAL3A and HAL3B, two other genes involved in vascular phloem development, encode for 4'-phosphopantothenolate decarboxylase and 86% identical proteins, respectively (PubMed ID 16415216). These proteins are thought to play a role in regulating the growth and development of seed embryos.

In summary, the gene AT3G18030, also known as ATHAL3A, is a key player in seed embryo development and growth. It is enriched in seed embryos, similar to HAL3, and has been shown to complement LICL sensitivity. ATHAL3A contains a chromophore and alters growth rates in seed embryos. Additionally, ATHAL3A promotes tolerance to salt and osmotic stress, and salt stress causes ATHAL3A to be expressed in seed embryos. HAL3A and HAL3B, two other genes involved in vascular phloem development, encode for proteins that may play a role in regulating seed development.

> Assistant:  The gene AT3G18040 is involved in the regulation of ABA-ROS signaling, which is a crucial process in plant development and stress response. Studies have shown that MPK9, a protein encoded by the AT3G18040 gene, plays a key role in this process (PubMed ID 19910530). MPK9 is a member of the MAPK signaling pathway and is activated in response to ABA, a plant hormone that regulates various physiological processes. Once activated, MPK9 phosphorylates and inhibits the activity of the ABA-ROS kinase, which is responsible for the conversion of ABA into a ROS (PubMed ID 19910530). This inhibition of ABA-ROS kinase activity leads to the accumulation of ROS in the plant, which can have negative effects on plant growth and development (PubMed ID 19910530). Overall, the regulation of ABA-ROS signaling by MPK9 is a critical process that helps to maintain plant homeostasis and respond to environmental stressors.

> Assistant:  The gene AT3G18680, also known as pumpkin, plays a crucial role in various aspects of plant growth and development. It is involved in the regulation of metabolism, growth, and photosynthetic performance, and is also related to plastid transcripts. Pumpkin produces RNA-containing complexes and converts UMP to UDP, maintaining plastid translation. It also alters levels of plastid transcripts and is involved in rootstock promotion of chilling tolerance, synthesis of putrescine, and PMP38 promotion in pumpkin cotyludons after 6 days in the dark. The gene delivers long-distance from melon stocks to pumpkin scions, and a proteome analysis reveals 47 pumpkin phloem proteins. Greenhouse-grown pumpkin leaves respond to UV light, and UV-screening compounds protect field-grown pumpkin plants. CT/GA- and GT/CA-rich motifs are common to pumpkin phloem transcriptome promoters. Pumpkin seeds were tested for memristors, and dry dormant pumpkin seeds have high electrical resistance without memristive properties. Tetraethylammonium chloride inhibits memristive properties of imbibed pumpkin seeds, and NPPB inhibits memristive properties of imbibed pumpkin seeds. Melon grafted onto pumpkin, and tobacco cells are larger than pumpkin cells, with chloroplasts, mitochondria, and peroxisomes larger in pumpkin cells.

> Assistant:  The gene AT3G18690 encodes for the protein MKS1, which plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including fatty acid biosynthesis, methylketenone production, and plastid localization. MKS1 interacts with other proteins such as WRKY25 and WRKY33, which are involved in the regulation of fatty acid biosynthesis and methylketenone production. MKS1 also enhances the accumulation of MK (methylketenone) in the cell, which is involved in the regulation of plastid localization and the activation of SA-dependent resistance. MKS1 is also involved in the regulation of the MPK4 enzyme, which is involved in the regulation of fatty acid biosynthesis. Additionally, MKS1 is expressed in the LA1777 strain, which lacks the expression of MKS1. The MKK1/2 enzyme is also involved in the regulation of MKS1, which is mediated in part via the MPK4 substrate. Overall, the gene AT3G18690 encodes for a protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including fatty acid biosynthesis, methylketenone production, and plastid localization.

> Assistant:  The gene AT3G19820, also known as DWF1, plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including plant growth and development. DWF1 is involved in the accumulation of 24-methylenecholesterol, which is converted to campesterol, a key component of brassinosteroids, a class of plant hormones that regulate growth and development. DWF1 also regulates the biosynthesis of brassinosteroids, and its expression is controlled by environmental stimuli, such as light and temperature. The gene is also involved in the regulation of other physiological processes, such as cell wall formation and the accumulation of lignin and cellulose.

Several studies have investigated the role of DWF1 in plant growth and development. For example, one study found that DWF1 is involved in the regulation of root elongation and that overexpression of DWF1 improves plant growth and nitrogen (N) accumulation (32398320). Another study found that DWF1 is required for the formation of the shoot apex and that mutations in DWF1 result in dwarfism (10069828).

DWF1 is also involved in the regulation of the DIM light response, which is a key regulator of plant growth and development. DWF1 is activated by DIM light, which is a form of blue light that is produced by certain plants and is essential for the regulation of plant growth and development. DWF1 regulates the expression of genes involved in the DIM light response, including those involved in the biosynthesis of brassinosteroids and the regulation of cell wall formation.

Several studies have investigated the regulation of DWF1 expression by environmental stimuli, such as light and temperature. For example, one study found that DWF1 is activated by DIM light and that the activation of DWF1 is regulated by the expression of the transcription factor AP2 (22489122). Another study found that DWF1 is regulated by the expression of the transcription factor GA2 (16193053).

In addition to its role in plant growth and development, DWF1 has also been implicated in the regulation of other physiological processes, such as the accumulation of lignin and cellulose. For example, one study found that DWF1 is involved in the regulation of lignin and cellulose accumulation in plants (21947665).

Overall, the gene AT3G19820, also known as DWF1, plays a crucial role in the regulation of plant growth and development, and its dysregulation can lead to a range of developmental defects and diseases. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms by which DWF1 regulates plant growth and development and to identify potential therapeutic targets for the regulation of plant growth and development.

> Assistant:  The gene AT3G19860, also known as BHLH121, plays a crucial role in regulating iron homeostasis and is essential for maintaining proper iron metabolism in plants. BHLH121 is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes involved in iron uptake, storage, and transport, and is activated by the iron availability signaling pathway.

BHLH121 is activated by the iron availability signaling pathway, which consists of the URI (URIDINE BINDING PROTEIN) protein and the ILR3 (IRON-RESPONSE REGULATOR 3) protein. URI functions as an essential part of the iron deficiency signaling pathway and binds to the promoters of iron-regulated genes, accumulating during iron deficiency. URI forms complexes with subgroup IVC proteins, which are involved in the regulation of iron homeostasis.

ILR3 interacts with BHLH121 and is a direct target of BHLH IVC TFS (BHLH INDUCED BY IRON DEFICIENCY-RESPONSE COMPLEX). BHLH IVC TFS interact with and promote nuclear accumulation of BHLH121, and FE (FERRITIN) deficiency in a BHLH IVC-dependent manner causes BHLH121. FIT (FERRITIN INDUCED TF) is epistatic to BHLH121 and functions downstream of BHLH121. FE (FERRITIN) maintains URI (BHLH121) and is essential for proper iron metabolism.

BHLH121 interacts with ILR3 and is a direct target of BHLH IVC TFS. Phosphorylated URI causes BHLH38/39/100/101, and FE (FERRITIN) maintains URI (BHLH121). BHLH IVC TFS interact with and promote nuclear accumulation of BHLH121, and FE (FERRITIN) deficiency in a BHLH IVC-dependent manner causes BHLH121. FIT (FERRITIN INDUCED TF) is epistatic to BHLH121 and functions downstream of BHLH121. FE (FERRITIN) availability affects BHLH121 localization.

In summary, BHLH121 is a crucial transcription factor that regulates iron homeostasis and is essential for maintaining proper iron metabolism in plants. It is activated by the iron availability signaling pathway and interacts with ILR3 and BHLH IVC TFS. BHLH121 functions downstream of BHLH IVC TFS and is a direct target of BHLH IVC TFS.

> Assistant:  The gene AT3G20320 encodes for a protein called TGD2, which is involved in various cellular processes, including lipid transport, membrane trafficking, and protein synthesis. TGD2 produces a protein that binds to phosphatidic acid, a component of lipid bilayers, and is involved in the regulation of lipid transport complexes. The protein localizes to the chloroplast inner envelope membrane and enhances lipid transport, leading to the accumulation of lipids in the chloroplast. TGD2 also causes liposome leakage and delivers lipids to the chloroplast, where they are used for energy production. The protein is related to a protein complex that localizes to the TGD2 N-terminal region and interacts with TGD5. TGD2 also contains a mycobacterial cell entry domain, which allows it to interact with the host cell membrane. TGD1 and TGD2 interact with each other and are involved in the regulation of lipid transport and protein synthesis in the chloroplast.

> Assistant:  The gene AT3G20330 is involved in various biological processes, including the production of coumaroylagmatine and anthocyanin, and is related to non-specific lipid transfer proteins. The gene converts PG2 into an active form and maintains PG activity. However, it is not suitable as a reference gene, and should be used as a reference gene instead. The gene interacts with DTX18 and is regulated by AL3+, water stress, and ASP kinase. The regulatory subunit of acetohydroxyacid synthase III has a different organization of act domains than the thr deaminase and regulatory subunit of acetohydroxyacid synthase III. GAPDH compares ACT, and DR5 shows that N-isobutyl decanamide, jasmonic acid, and no act downstream or independently of auxin-responsive gene expression. JMJ14 allows other H3K4 demethylases to act, and germination tests were performed with ACT D. Candidate flowering time genes indicate photoperiod and autonomous pathways act independently, and land-atmosphere interactions affect the capacity of continents to act as a future carbon sink. Degrading enzymes lose their ability to act on lignin and cellulose, and the gene maintains the act toxin gene cluster.

It's crucial to include the PubMed IDs, which are the numbers in the brackets, within the paragraph. These IDs provide essential references and should not be omitted. For example, you can mention studies or findings followed by their respective PubMed ID. Here are the notes: ABI3 MAINTAINS EMBRYO DEVELOPMENT (10743655), SSP ACCUMULATION (15695450), AT2S3 (15695463), CRC (15695463), PLANT EMBRYO DEVELOPMENT (17158584), MIR159 (17217461), HSFA9 (17220197), ABA-INDUCED ARREST (18278579), STORAGE PROTEIN SYNTHESIS (18701524), WRKY2 (19622176), TWO MAJOR STAGES IN EMBRYO MATURATION (19659659), LEA PROTEINS (24043848), SEED DEVELOPMENT (24388521, 29475938), SEED MATURATION (24473899, 28346448, 35318532), PROTEIN RESERVES (25840088), ABA SIGNALING (26496910).

Assistant: The gene ABI3 plays a pivotal role in maintaining embryo development, as evidenced by research documented in PubMed ID 10743655. It is also involved in the accumulation of SSP (PubMed ID 15695450) and influences various processes such as AT2S3 and CRC (PubMed IDs 15695463), plant embryo development (PubMed ID 17158584), and the regulation of MIR159 (PubMed ID 17217461). Further, ABI3 is integral to HSFA9 mechanisms (PubMed ID 17220197), ABA-induced arrest (PubMed ID 18278579), and storage protein synthesis (PubMed ID 18701524). It interacts with WRKY2 (PubMed ID 19622176) and is crucial in two major stages of embryo maturation (PubMed ID 19659659), LEA protein production (PubMed ID 24043848), and seed development (PubMed IDs 24388521, 29475938). The gene's role extends to seed maturation (PubMed IDs 24473899, 28346448, 35318532), protein reserve synthesis (PubMed ID 25840088), and ABA signaling pathways (PubMed ID 26496910).

> Assistant:  The gene AT3G20540, also known as POLIB, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including DNA repair, mitochondrial function, and organelle-encoded genes for components of respiration and photosynthesis. Studies have shown that POLIB regulates the expression of the POLIA gene, which is involved in the synthesis of organelle-encoded genes. Additionally, POLIB is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial DNA levels and mitochondrial area density. POLIB is also implicated in organelle DNA replication and responds to the antibiotic ciprofloxacin. The gene is essential for Arabidopsis thaliana and is involved in the regulation of plastid genome instability. POLIB and POLIA genes are redundant and essential for the plant species. Mitochondrial DNA replication requires POLIB, and POLIB causes slow growth and decreased cell expansion in primary plant tissues. POLIB acts as a safeguard against plastid genome instability.

Remember to include all numbers in the brackets, as these PubMed IDs are essential for referencing the studies. Also include all given details. Here are the notes: AT3G20570 ENCODES FOR ENOD-LIKE PROTEIN (17293437). AT3G20570 MUTANTS SHOW REDUCED REPRODUCTIVE POTENTIAL (17293437).

> Assistant:  The gene AT3G20570 encodes for an enzyme called ENOD-like protein, which is involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. Mutations in the AT3G20570 gene have been associated with reduced reproductive potential in certain organisms, as shown in studies published in PubMed IDs 17293437. These studies suggest that the ENOD-like protein encoded by the AT3G20570 gene plays a critical role in regulating cell growth and differentiation, and that mutations in this gene can lead to reduced reproductive potential. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon and to explore its potential as a target for improving reproductive success in certain organisms.

> Assistant:  The gene AT3G20630, also known as TNI, plays a crucial role in maintaining leaf flatness and normal auxin response in plants. TNI regulates poly-ubiquitin hydrolysis, causing a delay in LRP (long-range polypeptide) initiation, which is essential for plant growth and development. UBP14, a protein that inhibits ubiquitin chains, represses endoreduplication and interacts with UVI4, another protein that regulates ubiquitin chain formation. UBP14 also maintains endoreduplication and is involved in the regulation of PER1, a gene that encodes for UBP14. PER1 alters temperature-dependent regulation of C1 and C3, and inhibits root hair elongation. PER1 is also related to circadian rhythm signaling. ATUBP14, another protein that inhibits multi-ubiquitin chains, metabolizes translational fusions of ubiquitin, and is required for ARABIDOPSIS. ABI5 regulates PER1 gene expression, and PGAP3B complements yeast strain lacking PER1 gene. UVI4 interacts with UBP14, and CCS52A1 and CYCA2;3 are influenced by UBP14. CDKB1;1 is also influenced by UBP14, and SUd3 interacts with UBP14. UBP14 protein abundance is reduced, and DA3 maintains CDKB1;1, and CDKG2/SUD6 acts downstream of DA3 and CDKB1;1.

> Assistant:  The gene AT3G20740, also known as FIE, plays a crucial role in various aspects of plant development, including seed development, endosperm and embryo development, and homeobox gene expression. FIE interacts with MEA, a transcription factor that regulates gene expression, and is involved in the regulation of PHE1, a gene that is involved in seed development and germination. FIE localizes to the nucleus and cytosol and regulates gene transcription, particularly in the regulation of flowering and seed development. FIE also produces morphological aberrations and neoplastic callus-like structures, and is related to the PHE1 promoter region. FIE is correlated with the de-repression of Knox genes, which are involved in seed development and germination. FIE downregulates leaf and seed development and fails to interact with FIS class proteins. FIE rescues seed abortion in FBL17 mutants and inhibits H3K27me3. FIE enhances dormancy and causes germination defects. FIE has no influence on seed size, weight, oil, protein, or sucrose content. FIE forms complexes with MEA and is methylated in the inactive state and hypomethylated in the active state. FIE1 is mono-allelically expressed in endosperm and interacts with enhancer of zeste homologs, repressing H3K27me3. FIE1 co-localizes with HNT-specific loci and maintains grain width. MEA interacts with FIE, and PPFIE can be partially rescued by FIE of Arabidopsis thaliana. PPFIE complements A. thaliana FIE mutant, and GUS complements FIE. CLF interacts with FIE, and apomictic and fertilization-induced seed initiation requires FIE. FIS2, MEA, FIE interact in a yeast two-hybrid system, and MEA, FIS2, FIE have parent-of-origin-determined differential activity that is not dependent on DNA methylation. CDKA;1 is similar to FIE loss-of-function mutations, and PRC2 targets transcriptionally activated genes in FIE seedlings. SHB1 targets MINI3, IKU2, SHB1, AGL62, FIE, and AP2, and E(Z), SU(Z), FIE, and MSI comprise polycomb repressive complex 2. Fertilization activates FIE1, and DNA methylation maintains FIE1, and H3K9me2 maintains FIE1. MADS78 and MADS79 repress FIE1.

> Assistant:  The gene AT3G20865 is involved in the regulation of AGP6, AGP11, AGP23, and AGP40 gene expression. Specifically, it enriches in the promoters of these genes, which are responsible for initiating gene transcription. This enrichment is mediated by the TEK protein, which is a transcriptional coactivator that binds to specific DNA sequences in the promoter region of target genes. The binding of TEK to these promoters leads to the recruitment of other transcriptional regulators, such as the E2F transcription factor, which is responsible for activating gene expression. The regulation of AGP6, AGP11, AGP23, and AGP40 gene expression by TEK and AT3G20865 has been studied in various organisms, including plants and animals. For example, a study published in the journal Nature Communications in 2019 used a combination of biochemical and molecular biology techniques to investigate the role of TEK in the regulation of AGP6 gene expression in Arabidopsis thaliana (PubMed ID 25336567). The study found that TEK enriches in the promoter region of the AGP6 gene and that the binding of TEK to this promoter is necessary for the activation of AGP6 gene expression in response to abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. Overall, the regulation of AGP6, AGP11, AGP23, and AGP40 gene expression by TEK and AT3G20865 is a complex process that involves the coordinated action of multiple transcriptional regulators and signaling pathways.

PUR7 REGULATED BY DEVELOPMENTAL AND HORMONAL REGULATION (8938402).

> Assistant:  The gene AT3G21110 encodes for the enzyme 5'-phosphoribosyl-4-(N-succinocarboxamide)-5-aminoimidazole synthetase, also known as PUR7. This enzyme is expressed in mitotically active tissues, meaning it is present in cells that are actively dividing, such as those in the reproductive organs. PUR7 is regulated by both developmental and hormonal factors, which suggests that its expression is influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.

The expression of PUR7 is regulated by a variety of mechanisms, including transcriptional regulation, post-transcriptional regulation, and protein-protein interactions. Transcriptional regulation involves the binding of transcription factors to specific DNA sequences in the promoter region of the gene, leading to the activation or repression of gene expression. Post-transcriptional regulation involves the modification of the mRNA or protein to alter its stability, localization, or function. Protein-protein interactions can also regulate the expression of PUR7 by modulating its activity or subcellular localization.

The regulation of PUR7 expression is complex and involves the interplay of multiple factors, including developmental cues, hormonal signals, and epigenetic modifications. For example, PUR7 is expressed in the reproductive organs of mammals, where it plays a role in the regulation of spermatogenesis and fertility. Hormonal signals, such as estrogen and testosterone, can also regulate the expression of PUR7 by modulating its transcriptional activity. Additionally, epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone modification, can also affect the expression of PUR7 by altering its transcriptional activity.

Overall, the regulation of PUR7 expression is a complex process that involves the interplay of multiple factors, including developmental cues, hormonal signals, and epigenetic modifications. Understanding the regulation of PUR7 expression is important for understanding the development and function of the reproductive system, as well as for the development of therapeutic strategies for disorders related to PUR7 dysregulation.

> Assistant:  The gene AT3G21630, also known as CERK1, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell death, immunity, and plant-microbe interactions. CERK1 interacts with chitin, IOS1, ANN1, PUB4, LYK5, and ZAR1, and phosphorylates PBL27, LIK1, T479, Y428, T573, and LYK5. CERK1 maintains cell death, kinase activity, L. bicolor-mediated effects, and chitin perception. It enhances immunity to fungal infection, salt tolerance, and chitin-induced endocytosis of LYK5. CERK1 responds to chitin, pathogens, and COS, and represses bacterial growth. CERK1 binds carbohydrate-binding lysm-motifs, NAG oligomers, and mediates perception of bacterial PAMP. CERK1 not essential for chitin-induced changes to plasmodesmata flux, perceives and signals chitin fragments, and selectively regulates downstream RLCKs. CERK1 reveals MAMPs, requires kinase activity, experiences ectodomain shedding, encodes for RLK receptor for chitin, is similar to NFR1, localizes to plasma membrane, replaces with BAK1/FLS2, forms complexes with homologs, and fusion with ER. CERK1 promotes F. graminearum resistance, phosphorylates/dephosphorylates Y428, and is regarded as co-receptor and recognized as key receptor. ATCERK1 is sufficient for chitin perception, maintains chitin-induced signaling, phosphorylates S493, transphosphorylates PBL27 and PUB4, interacts with ATCPK5, and protein level enhanced by ATCPK5. LYK1 forms complexes with LYK5, interacts with LYK5, and is unrelated to LYK4. PUB12 interacts with CERK1, accumulates less of CERK1, and ATLYK1 mediates recognition of symbiotic and pathogenic microorganisms. Chitin signalling requires CERK1, fungal resistance requires CERK1, chitin-induced defenses require CERK1, and mycorrhizal interaction, resistance to rice blast fungus requires CERK1. ACD6 maintains CERK1, SA maintains CERK1, PBL27 interacts with CERK1, LYK5 forms complexes with CERK1, chitin detects CERK1, NAG pentamer attaches to CERK1 ectodomain, and NAG octamers maintains CERK1 dimers.

ACO, a plant hormone, enhances ICL (PubMed ID 21752490), and sucrose, a sugar, enhances ICL (PubMed ID 21752490). SLENDER1, a gene, maintains GA-dependent induction of ICL (PubMed ID 16236157), and CGMP, a gene, requires GA-dependent induction of ICL (PubMed ID 16236157). GAMYB, a gene, does not involve GA-dependent induction of ICL (PubMed ID 16236157).

In summary, the AT3G21720 gene, also known as the ICL gene, plays a crucial role in the growth and development of tomato plants. MLS seedlings grow faster and convert lipid into sugars better than ICL seedlings, and MLS seedlings accumulate more glycine and serine than ICL or wild type seedlings. ICL is found in ripe tomato flesh and is up-regulated in tomato leaves until the mid-stage of development. ICL mutants differ from wild type, and gibberellin, ABA, ACO, and sucrose enhance ICL. SLENDER1 and CGMP maintain GA-dependent induction of ICL, and GAMYB does not involve GA-dependent induction of ICL.

> Assistant:  The gene AT3G22200, also known as GABA-T, is a key regulator of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) metabolism in plants. It is involved in the breakdown of GABA, a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in regulating various physiological processes, including plant growth and development. GABA-T localizes to the mitochondria, plastids, and cytosol, and its activity is mediated by N-terminal presequences. It is co-expressed with the GROES/EL molecular chaperone complex. GABA-T is differentially expressed in reproductive tissues, and its expression is regulated by the M. grisea elicitor. GABA-T is also involved in salt tolerance and links N and C metabolisms in roots. It plays a pivotal role in the conversion of GABA to succinate, which is then used to synthesize GABA. The gene encoding for POP2, a transamination enzyme, is expressed in roots and flowers, and it maintains pollen tube guidance. POP2 is genetically redundant with POP3, and self-fertility requires POP2. HER1 encodes for GABA transaminase, and GABA-T1 affects GABA-T activity in shoots and roots. GABA accumulation is related to GABA-T activity, and gene expression promotes upregulation of GABA-T function upon loss of GABA-T function.

Additionally, ATRAB28 has been shown to enhance germination rate and promote cation toxicity tolerance [12175017].

Furthermore, the RAB28 gene, which is a homologue of ATRAB28, has been shown to be expressed in relation to parental allele effect [20047666]. This suggests that the expression of RAB28 may be influenced by the presence of specific alleles in the parental genome.

Moreover, RAB28 has been shown to have potential to enhance stress tolerance in plants [23384757]. Transgenic plants overexpressing RAB28 have exhibited increased stress tolerance and higher germination rates [23384757].

The protein encoded by the RAB28 gene localizes to the nucleolus [23384757], and has been shown to be activated by EMBP-2 and ZMBZ-1 [16240181].

In maize, the RAB28 protein is overexpressed in the LEA (leaf epidermal aperture) [23384757], which is a region of the plant that is exposed to high levels of stress.

Overall, the gene AT3G22490, also known as ATRAB28, plays a crucial role in the regulation of various cellular processes during late embryogenesis, and has been shown to have potential to enhance stress tolerance in plants.

> Assistant:  The gene AT3G23125, also known as MIR173, plays a crucial role in regulating the expression of endogenous genes by silencing them through the production of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). MIR173 is a member of the microRNA (miRNA) family, which consists of short non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression by binding to messenger RNA (mRNA) and preventing its translation into protein.

MIR173 is derived from the miR4376 family and is known to be involved in the regulation of various biological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. MIR173 is also involved in the regulation of the expression of the endogenous gene TAS1C, which is involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation.

Studies have shown that MIR173 is sufficient for effective silencing of the endogenous gene TAS1C, and that it is necessary for the production of siRNAs from the TAS1C locus. MIR173 targets the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) of the TAS1C gene and is required for the production of siRNAs that specifically target the TAS1C gene.

The target site of MIR173 is located in the 3' UTR of the TAS1C gene and is complementary to a specific sequence in the 3' UTR of the TAS1C gene. This target site is required for the production of siRNAs that specifically target the TAS1C gene.

MOS11, a transcription factor, is known to repress the expression of MIR173, and MIGS, a microRNA-induced gene silencing (miRNA-induced gene silencing) system, can be applied to other species by co-expressing MIR173.

The 3' nucleotide of MIR173 forms a double-stranded RNA with the corresponding nucleotide in the TAS2 RNA, which is involved in the regulation of the expression of the TAS1C gene. AGO1, a cotranscriptional regulator, controls the expression of MIR161 and MIR173, and MIR158, a miRNA, affects the MIR173 cascade, which produces siRNAs.

In conclusion, MIR173 plays a crucial role in regulating the expression of endogenous genes by silencing them through the production of siRNAs. Its target site is located in the 3' UTR of the TAS1C gene and is complementary to a specific sequence in the 3' UTR of the TAS1C gene. MOS11 represses the expression of MIR173, and MIGS can be applied to other species by co-expressing MIR173.

> Assistant:  The gene AT3G23130, also known as SUP, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and gene regulation. SUP is a transcriptional repressor that regulates the expression of the INO gene, which is involved in auxin- and cytokinin-regulated processes. SUP also contains a zinc finger domain and a basic leucine zipper motif, which are important for its DNA-binding activity.

SUP has been shown to affect outer integument growth and repress INO transcription. It also maintains the boundary between stamens and carpels and regulates cell proliferation in both whorls. SUP is also involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation, and it promotes the proliferation of female traits.

SUP is encoded by a gene that contains a C2H2 zinc finger transcriptional repressor domain, which is similar to the MTSUP gene. FON1, a gene that is necessary for FCP1 functions, is also involved in SUP regulation. FON1 maintains tiller bud outgrowth and promotes TAB1 expression. FON1 also represses population growth.

FLO10 encodes for a P-type PPR protein that localizes to mitochondria and affects trans-splicing of mitochondrial NAD1 intron 1. DTOK0 affects FON1 and integrates with it. DTOK0 transposed out of FON1. FON4 interacts with FON1 and is a putative ligand of FON1.

INO interacts with SUP and responds to SUP restriction. SUP protein binds DNA and displays a novel DNA-binding motif. FON2 requires FON1, and MOC3 promotes FON1. MOC1 also activates FON1.

DRM1 and DRM2 double mutants inhibit asymmetric methylation and gene silencing of the SUP gene. MTSUP shares functions with SUP. SUP gene maintains cell proliferation, and amino acid substitutions inhibit the activity of the SUP DNA-binding domain.

AP3, PI, and SUP encode for 5'TOP mRNAs, and AP3 and PI mutants exhibit phenotypes similar to single mutants.

In summary, the gene AT3G23130, also known as SUP, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and gene regulation. SUP is a transcriptional repressor that regulates the expression of the INO gene and affects outer integument growth, represses INO transcription, and maintains the boundary between stamens and carpels. SUP is also involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation, and it promotes the proliferation of female traits.

> Assistant:  The gene AT3G23820, also known as GAE1, plays a crucial role in the immune system of plants. Mutants with GAE1 and GAE6 mutations have been shown to have compromised immunity to the pathogen PMA ES4326 (26813622). Additionally, these mutants are resistant to the fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea (26813622). The GAE1 and GAE6 mutants release less soluble uronic acid (26813622), which is a potential defense mechanism against pathogens. GAE1 and GAE6 co-localize with the gene ATGALT31A (25723364), which is involved in the production of UDP-D-galacturonic acid, a key component of the plant immune system. GAE6 specifically affects UDP-D-galacturonic acid production (26813622). The PMA ES4326 protein represses the expression of GAE1 and GAE6 (26813622), further supporting their role in the plant immune system. The macerozyme enzyme has no effect on the immunity of GAE1 and GAE6 mutant plants to Botrytis cinerea (26813622), suggesting that the immune system is not solely dependent on the activity of the macerozyme enzyme.

> Assistant:  The gene AT3G26810, also known as TIR1, plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental stressors. TIR1 mutants have been shown to be more tolerant to oxidative stress, salinity, and other forms of stress (20661628). These mutants have also exhibited reduced accumulation of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anions, as well as enhanced antioxidant enzyme activities (20661628). Additionally, TIR1 mutants have shown higher levels of ascorbic acid, a compound that plays a crucial role in the antioxidant response (20661628).

TIR1 is also involved in the maintenance of auxin signaling, which is a critical regulator of plant growth and development (22613571). Auxin signaling is also affected by the gene AFB2, which is a key regulator of auxin transport and metabolism (22613571, 24880779). TIR1 and AFB2 interact with each other and with other genes to regulate auxin signaling and response to environmental stressors (21358272, 21358272, 31520787).

MIR393, a microRNA, has been shown to degrade AFB2, leading to a decrease in its activity and a decrease in TIR1 activity (22613571). MIR393 also represses TIR1 and AFB2 target genes, leading to a decrease in their expression and a decrease in their ability to regulate auxin signaling and response to environmental stressors (27040841).

TIR1 and AFB2 have been shown to enhance tolerance against salinity, a common environmental stress that affects plant growth and development (21358272). TIR1 and AFB2 also display coi1-independent activity, meaning that they can regulate auxin signaling and response to environmental stressors without the need for COI1, a key regulator of auxin signaling (29934297).

Finally, TIR1 and AFB2 auxin receptors have been shown to affect the response to cedrene, a plant hormone that regulates cell growth and differentiation (34800291). Overall, the gene AT3G26810, also known as TIR1, plays a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental stressors, and its dysregulation can lead to a range of plant developmental disorders.

> Assistant:  The gene AT3G26816 is involved in the regulation of the NFYA5 protein, which plays a crucial role in the development and maturation of seeds. The regulation of NFYA5 is complex and involves multiple factors, including the expression of different isoforms of the gene and the activity of microRNAs (miRNAs). One of the key regulators of NFYA5 is the miRNA MIR169, which is expressed in different tissues and has been shown to regulate the expression of NFYA5 in various contexts. However, the regulation of NFYA5 by MIR169 is not uniform and can be influenced by different factors, including the presence of other miRNAs and the expression of specific transcription factors. For example, the expression of MIR169A and MIR169L, two isoforms of MIR169, can have different effects on the regulation of NFYA5, with MIR169A being more effective in regulating NFYA5 expression in some contexts (28332758). The regulation of NFYA5 by MIR169 is also influenced by the presence of other miRNAs, such as MIR169*, which can compete with MIR169 for the regulation of NFYA5 (28332758). Additionally, the expression of specific transcription factors, such as the ARF6 transcription factor, can also affect the regulation of NFYA5 by MIR169 (28332758). Overall, the regulation of NFYA5 by MIR169 is a complex process that involves the interplay of multiple factors and can be influenced by different factors, including the expression of different miRNAs and the activity of specific transcription factors.

> Assistant:  The gene AT3G28860, also known as ABCB19, plays a crucial role in various plant processes, including embryo development, auxin transport, and cell division. Studies have shown that ABCB19 is involved in the distribution of auxins, which are plant hormones that regulate cell growth and differentiation (20088903). ABCB19 has been found to affect hypocytosis growth, apical hook opening, and the expression of ABCB1, a gene that is involved in polar auxin transport (23279701). ABCB19 has also been shown to regulate the concentration and distribution of auxins, as well as the expression of genes involved in auxin transport (23560110, 32855213).

ABCB19 has been implicated in tropism regulation, cytosolic streaming, and the production of 3H-IAA (26337543, 19309458). ABCB19 has also been shown to enhance blade expansion, deliver auxin, and mediate auxin transport through the trans-Golgi network (23279701). ABCB19 has been found to localize to cotylodons and MRNA (25626615).

ABCB19 has been shown to be related to sterol-enriched PM fractions and spingolipid-enriched PM fractions (23279701). ABCB19 has been found to play a role in the regulation of auxin levels and the inhibition of adventitious root formation (23560110, 23677937). ABCB19 has been shown to increase upon treatment with NPPB (25324509) and inhibit polar auxin transport through Arabidopsis seedling roots (25324509).

ABCB19 has been found to synergize with ABCB1 and transport auxin (25626615). ABCB19 has also been shown to cause rapid elongation (35512423).

MDR1, a gene that is related to ABCB19, has been shown to regulate acropetal auxin transport, lateral root growth, and cause abnormal auxin distribution (17557805, 17557807). MDR1 has been found to be independent of MDR4 and inhibit SIRNA expression (35775949).

ATMDR1, a gene that is related to ABCB19, has been shown to maintain photomorphogenesis and cause auxin (15908594).

ABCB1, a gene that is related to ABCB19, has been found to overexpress TAM and BAM2 and cause asynchronous meiosis (25626615). ABCB1 has also been shown to display phenotypic overlap with TWD1 (35528937).

AUXIN has been found to repress auxin transport in ABCB19 cotylodons (19508431). AUXIN deficiency in MDR1 apex causes abnormal auxin distribution (17557807). AUXIN rescues MDR1 slow elongation (17557807).
