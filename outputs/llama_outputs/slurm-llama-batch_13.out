> Assistant:  The gene AT3G09560, also known as PAH1, plays a crucial role in regulating various cellular processes, including phospholipid biosynthesis, membrane association, and ER morphology. Studies have shown that PAH1 regulates the activity of CDKs, which are essential for cell division and proliferation. PAH1 also affects the accumulation of PA, a phospholipid that is involved in cell signaling and membrane trafficking.

One of the key functions of PAH1 is to regulate phospholipid biosynthesis. Studies have shown that PAH1 represses the activity of CDKs, which in turn reduces the synthesis of phospholipids. This is evident in the double mutant PAH1-PAH2, which contains a ~1.8-fold increase in phospholipid synthesis compared to the wild-type strain. Additionally, the PAH1-PAH2 double mutant displays gross changes in ER morphology, suggesting that PAH1 regulates the formation and maintenance of the ER membrane.

PAH1 also localizes to the UUQA5-7 region of the ER membrane, where it interacts with CDKs and regulates their activity. The interaction between PAH1 and CDKs is essential for the regulation of phospholipid biosynthesis and membrane association.

Furthermore, PAH1 regulates the expression of other genes involved in cellular processes, such as PEAMT1 and RTNLB13. PEAMT1 is upregulated at the level of transcription in PAH1-PAH2 leaves, suggesting that PAH1 regulates the expression of this gene. RTNLB13, on the other hand, induces tubulation in PAH1-PAH2 mutant, suggesting that PAH1 regulates the formation of tubules.

PAH1 also regulates the activity of MG (2+) and PA, which are involved in cell signaling and membrane trafficking. MG (2+) activates PAH1 and PAH2, while PA accumulates in PAH1-PAH2. CCT1, a transcription factor, overexpresses to replicate the PAH1-PAH2 phenotype, suggesting that PAH1 regulates the expression of CCT1.

Finally, PAH1 regulates the biosynthesis of PC, a phospholipid that is involved in cell signaling and membrane trafficking. PAH1 has a CDK-insensitive version, which represses the biosynthesis of PC, suggesting that PAH1 regulates the expression of this version.

In conclusion, the gene AT3G09560, also known as PAH1, plays a crucial role in regulating various cellular processes, including phospholipid biosynthesis, membrane association, and ER morphology. PAH1 regulates the activity of CDKs, which are essential for cell division and proliferation, and affects the accumulation of PA, a phospholipid that is involved in cell signaling and membrane trafficking. PAH1 also localizes to the UUQA5-7 region of the ER membrane and regulates the expression of other genes involved in cellular processes. Overall, PAH1 is a key regulator of cellular processes and plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis.

Furthermore, NTL4 has been found to be unrelated to lignin polymers, as it is not involved in the synthesis or degradation of lignin (PubMed ID 36168143). However, NTL4 has been shown to be disconnected from lignin-derived monomers, suggesting that it may play a role in regulating the formation and degradation of lignin (PubMed ID 36168143). Overexpression of NTL4 has also been shown to promote the production of active forms of NTL4, which in turn promotes ROS production (PubMed ID 22313226). Furthermore, NTL4 mutants are tolerant to drought conditions, suggesting that NTL4 plays a critical role in regulating plant cell survival under stressful conditions (PubMed ID 22313226). Additionally, the oxidoreductase domain of the MDAR protein has been found to be similar to the AIF protein, which is involved in the regulation of ROS production and the accumulation of lignin (PubMed ID 19182226). Furthermore, fine roots dominate the fluxes of AIF and condensed tannins, suggesting that the regulation of these processes is critical for plant growth and development (PubMed ID 26073624). Overall, the gene AT3G10500, also known as NTL4, plays a crucial role in regulating various cellular processes, including the production of ROS and the accumulation of lignin, and is essential for plant cell survival under stressful conditions.

The balance between IAA17 and WOX5 is maintained by IAA17, which acts as a negative regulator of WOX5 (PubMed ID: 23939433).

WOX5 is limited to quiescent cells (PubMed ID: 25438658), and its expression is down-regulated in ELP2 mutant cells (PubMed ID: 25998905). WOX5 signals from quiescent cells and contributes to cellular identity (PubMed IDs: 26019259, 32400913). WOX5 functions with WOX1 and WOX3 to regulate stem cell maintenance (PubMed ID: 33035489). WOX5 causes stem cell identity and is activated by auxin (PubMed IDs: 17158109, 20543136).

IAA17 inhibits WOX5, and its repression is mediated by the IAA17 protein (PubMed IDs: 24056047, 24056047). The TIN mutant displays chimeric WOX5, and the combination of turanose and auxin causes WOX5 (PubMed IDs: 16262712, 16262712). CLE40 and ARF10 repress WOX5 expression, while ARF16 and PLETHORA require WOX5 (PubMed IDs: 19820344, 20543136). NAA10/NAA15 affects WOX5 expression, and H3K36ME3 activates WOX5 (PubMed IDs: 30020502, 36250442).

WOX5 is similar to the P. abies gene, and PRL1 maintains WOX5 expression (PubMed IDs: 25438658, 25438658). OSIAA11 converges to WOX5 activation during callus formation (PubMed ID: 29788450). HERK2, HVARF04, HVEXPB1, PIN5, PIN7, PME5, and WOX5 are confirmed as promising candidates for WOX5 function (PubMed ID: 31122195). PGPB enhances WOX5 gene expression (PubMed ID: 31784832).

In summary, WOX5 is a crucial gene involved in various cellular processes, including stem cell maintenance, cell fate, and auxin signaling. Its expression is regulated by various factors, including IAA17, POL, and auxin. WOX5 is negatively regulated by IAA17 and is limited to quiescent cells. Its function is conserved across species, and it is similar to the P. abies gene.

> Assistant:  The gene AT3G11410, also known as PP2CA, is a key regulator of plant development and stress responses. It is involved in various cellular processes, including seed germination, root growth, and response to salinity and drought stress. PP2CA also plays a crucial role in ABA signaling pathways, which are important for plant growth and development.

Several studies have shown that PP2CA interacts with other proteins, such as OST1 and RCAR3, and that it is involved in the regulation of ABA sensitivity. PP2CA also affects seed/vegetative responses to ABA, enhances resistance to drought stress, and produces extreme responses to exogenous ABA. Additionally, PP2CA inhibits SLAC1 and localizes to the citrus genome.

The protein encoded by AT3G11410 contains a CCCH zinc-finger motif and mediates dephosphorylation of BRM. PP2CA also interacts with and inhibits SNRK2.4 and promotes RGLG1 interaction. PP2CA regulates ABA signal transduction and is disrupted in PP2CA-1 and PP2CA-2 mutants, which affect ABA sensitivity.

Other proteins, such as RH8, AHG3, ATX4, ATX5, and PYL13, have been shown to interact with PP2CA. RH8 inhibits PP2CA phosphatase activity, while AHG3 is identical to ATPP2CA and shares functions with it. ATX4 and ATX5 maintain AHG3, and PYL13 inhibits PP2CA. RGLG1/RGLG5 ubiquitinates PP2CA, and PIR1 determines PP2CA stability.

Mutations in ABI1 and AHG3 partially rescue COP1 stomatal phenotype, and ABI2 interacts with PP2CA. PYL4(A194T) forms stable complexes with PP2CA, and ABI1 partially redundant with PP2CA. RGLG1 interacts with PP2CA, and PIR2 interacts with PP2CA. ABA degrades PP2CA, and PIR1-1/PIR2 double mutant represses PP2CA degradation. ABA-dependent PP2CA turnover requires RGLG1/RGLG5.

ABSCISIC ACID positively impacts ATPP2CA, and AKT2 regulates activity of ATPP2CA. PP2CAOX mutant overexpresses ATPP2CA, and ABA-dependent PP2CA turnover requires RGLG1/RGLG5.

In summary, the gene AT3G11410, also known as PP2CA, is a key regulator of plant development and stress responses. It interacts with other proteins, affects ABA signaling pathways, and plays a crucial role in various cellular processes.

> Assistant:  The gene AT3G12820, also known as MYB10, plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of anthocyanins, a type of pigment that gives fruits and vegetables their characteristic colors. MYB10 is expressed in the fruit flesh and foliage of rosaceous species, and its expression is regulated by various factors, including fruit maturity, carbon starvation, and temperature.

Studies have shown that MYB10 promotes anthocyanin production by activating the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway (PubMed IDs 21410713, 34399121). MYB10 also regulates the accumulation of anthocyanins in the fruit flesh and foliage (PubMed ID 34399121). The gene is also involved in the regulation of UFGT and DFR genes, which are involved in the biosynthesis of anthocyanins (PubMed IDs 24102457, 23617716).

MYB10 is localized to the upstream regulatory region of the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway, and its expression is regulated by the 23-bp sequence motif (PubMed ID 19151225). MYB10 is also associated with increased anthocyanin concentration in striped varieties (PubMed ID 21599973).

MYB10 is different from MYB110A in its expression pattern and response to fruit maturity (PubMed ID 23096157). MYB10 is also hypo-methylated in the MCHG context (PubMed ID 31471637).

The 23-bp sequence motif in the promoter region of MYB10 enhances transactivation by the MYB10 protein (PubMed ID 19151225). The 23-bp sequence motif also binds to the MYB10 protein (PubMed ID 19151225).

Overexpression of MYB10 in tobacco, strawberry, and apple plants leads to increased anthocyanin production (PubMed ID 20302676). Carbon starvation positively impacts MYB10 expression (PubMed ID 31834629). A gypsy-transposon truncates MYB10 (PubMed ID 33004617). SPL13, ARF16, SCL6, and F-BOX1 proteins repress MYB10 expression (PubMed IDs 35348217, 35348217, 35348217, 35348217).

Temperature affects MYB10 expression (PubMed ID 21410713). Trim retrotransposon is found in the MYB10 promoter region (PubMed ID 21599973). POTRI.17G125700 encodes for functional MYB10 in Populus (PubMed ID 34399121).

In summary, the gene AT3G12820, also known as MYB10, plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of anthocyanins in rosaceous species. Its expression is regulated by various factors, including fruit maturity, carbon starvation, and temperature. MYB10 promotes anthocyanin production by activating the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway and regulates anthocyanin accumulation. The gene is also involved in the regulation of UFGT and DFR genes, and its expression is regulated by the 23-bp sequence motif. Overexpression of MYB10 leads to increased anthocyanin production, and its expression is affected by various factors, including carbon starvation and temperature.

> Assistant:  The gene AT3G12830 encodes a protein that targets the auxin-responsive protein Saur72 (PubMed ID: 36176687). This protein is involved in the regulation of cell division and differentiation, and its expression is influenced by auxins, which are plant hormones that play a crucial role in plant growth and development. The AT3G12830 protein is a member of the MIR399L family of microRNAs, which are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression by binding to messenger RNA (mRNA) and preventing its translation into protein. The AT3G12830 microRNA is specifically targeted to the Saur72 mRNA, leading to a decrease in Saur72 protein levels and a subsequent decrease in the expression of genes that are regulated by this protein. This regulation is thought to play a role in the regulation of cell division and differentiation in plant cells, and may be involved in the response to changes in auxin levels.

> Assistant:  The gene AT3G13290 encodes for the protein SNRK2, which is a serine/arginine kinase that plays a crucial role in regulating various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. SNRK2 has been shown to activate the VCR (vasoactive intestinal polypeptide receptor) protein, which is a key regulator of water and electrolyte homeostasis in the body. This process is mediated by SNRK2.6, which phosphorylates VCR, leading to its activation and subsequent regulation of water and electrolyte reabsorption in the kidneys. Additionally, SNRK2.10 has also been shown to phosphorylate VCR, further reinforcing its role in regulating VCR activity and its downstream effects on water and electrolyte homeostasis. Overall, the regulation of VCR activity by SNRK2 is a complex process that involves multiple phosphorylation events and downstream effects on cellular processes, and further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying this process.

> Assistant:  The gene AT3G13300, also known as VCS (Vacuole-Specific) gene, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including plant growth and development. VCS is a key regulator of protein synthesis and degradation, and its dysregulation has been implicated in various plant diseases.

VCS promotes global changes in the expression of proteins, which are involved in various cellular processes, including plant growth and development (PubMed ID: 27663407). VCS also encodes for a protein with a WD-domain, which is involved in the regulation of protein synthesis and degradation (PubMed ID: 14660546).

VCS plays a role in leaf blade formation and is involved in the regulation of TDT (Transcriptional Degradation Time) (PubMed ID: 14660546). VCS is also observed throughout the cell, but is few in the stationary phase (PubMed ID: 24929423).

VCS promotes growth and flowering of plant species, enhances photosynthesis, accumulates CKS and sugars, and causes PPGI-independent mechanisms (PubMed ID: 27092473). VCS maintains MRNA decay, represses MRNA decay, degrades MRNA, and affects plant development (PubMed ID: 29330694).

Fungal VCS accumulates H2O2, MVA-derived cytokinnins, ethylene, cyanide, and long-distance nitrogen transport amino acids (PubMed ID: 32515071). Fungal VCS also represses aquaporins, thiol redox, CLP protease system transcripts and proteins, and promotes growth and distinct developmental changes in Arabidopsis plants (PubMed ID: 30480826).

VCS also affects plant development, and is involved in the regulation of enzymes involved in the production of MVA-derived isoprenoids (PubMed ID: 32515071). VCS alters shikimate and MEP levels, enhances plastidial chaperonins and co-chaperonins, and produces 'S'-shaped and 'R'-shaped VCS (PubMed IDs: 20444214, 31828790).

VCS is also involved in the regulation of auxin transport inhibitors, which positively impact VCS (PubMed ID: 14660546). SNRK2 activates VCS, and XYLEM network topology affects VCS (PubMed IDs: 28059081, 30071137).

VCS is also involved in the regulation of gene expression, and affects VCS (PubMed ID: 31056686). SNRK2 activates VCS, SNRK2.5 phosphorylates VCS, SNRK2.6 phosphorylates VCS, and SNRK2.10 phosphorylates VCS (PubMed IDs: 31570508, 31570508, 31570508).

Microorganisms produce VCS, and GPT2 transcripts are enhanced by VCS (PubMed IDs: 36111879, 33747018). MRNAs accumulate in TDT and VCS mutants (PubMed ID: 17513503).

VCS is also involved in the regulation of plant responses to fungal VCS, and is essential for plant growth and development (PubMed IDs: 27092473, 33747018). CFBP1 mutant does not respond to fungal VCS (PubMed ID: 33747018). CLPR1-2 and CLPC1 mutants respond weakly to fungal VCS (PubMed ID: 33747018).

VCS strongly influences plant responses to fungal VCS, and plants exposed to charcoal-filtered fungal VCS are more resistant to fungal VCS (PubMed ID: 30480826). Posttranscriptional regulation regulates some plant responses to fungal VCS (PubMed ID: 30480826).

VCS is also involved in the regulation of plant responses to fungal VCS, and centrifuge produces intermediate VCS (PubMed IDs: 30997689, 32929748). AI produces intermediate VCS (PubMed ID: 32929748). MICROCT produces most resistant VCS (PubMed ID: 30997689). Optical causes most vulnerable VCS (PubMed ID: 30997689).

VCS non-responsive genes encodes for proteins differently expressed by fungal VCS (PubMed ID: 32515071). Genotype differs in stem VCS (PubMed ID: 32557592). BD produces more resistant VCS (PubMed ID: 32929748). PAD produces highly vulnerable VCS (PubMed ID: 32929748).

VCS is also involved in the regulation of plant responses to fungal VCS, and optional number of VCS benefits gene (PubMed ID: 34750914).

> Assistant:  The gene AT3G14210 encodes for the enzyme ESM1, which plays a crucial role in the synthesis of nitric oxide (NO) and isothiocyanate (ISC). ESM1 is a key regulator of nitric oxide formation, and its activity is epistatic, meaning that it affects the formation of NO in a specific manner. Specifically, ESM1 preferentially promotes the production of isothiocyanate, which is a precursor to NO. Additionally, ESM1 affects the glucosinolate hydrolysis profile, which is the process by which glucosinolates, a type of plant compound, are converted into isothiocyanate. ESM1 also enhances the activity of glucosinolate sulfotransferase (GSLS), an enzyme involved in the glucosinolate hydrolysis pathway. However, MECPP, a transcription factor, represses ESM1 activity, suggesting that ESM1 activity is regulated by multiple factors. Overall, the study of ESM1 and its role in nitric oxide synthesis has important implications for our understanding of plant defense mechanisms and the development of new drugs for plant-based applications.

MMDH2 has been shown to repress CD tolerance in various studies, including one published in the journal Cell Reports in 2017 (PubMed ID: 31617145). Additionally, MMDH2 has been shown to maintain ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species) levels in cells, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis (PubMed ID: 31617145). However, MMDH2 mutants have been shown to enhance CD tolerance, suggesting that MMDH2 may play a role in regulating cell death in response to DNA damage (PubMed ID: 31617145). Furthermore, MMDH2 mutants have been shown to repress H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide) levels in cells, which is important for maintaining cellular homeostasis (PubMed ID: 31617145). The protein PDR8 has also been shown to affect MMDH2 in mutant/MMDH2-overexpressing lines, suggesting that PDR8 may play a role in regulating MMDH2 function (PubMed ID: 31617145). Overall, these studies suggest that MMDH2 plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating various physiological processes, including cell death and DNA damage response.

> Assistant:  The gene AT3G15095 encodes for the protein HCF243, which is involved in the chloroplast's photosynthetic process. HCF243 interacts with the D1 protein, which is also involved in the photosynthetic process. HCF243 maintains the stability of D1 protein and promotes the assembly of the PSII complex, which is responsible for the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis. In contrast, HCF243 causes the synthesis of D1 protein to occur at a lower rate and the degradation of D1 protein to occur at a higher rate, leading to a retarded assembly of the PSII complex. These changes in HCF243 lead to a decrease in the efficiency of photosynthesis.

> Assistant:  The gene AT3G15352, also known as ATCOX17, plays a crucial role in the response of plants to stress conditions. Studies have shown that ATCOX17 complements the mutant COX17 gene in yeast, indicating that they share a similar function (PubMed ID: 12177498). ATCOX17 has been shown to cause a hyper-sensitive response-like necrotic response in tobacco leaves, which is likely due to its ability to induce stress responses (PubMed ID: 12177498). ATCOX17 has also been shown to increase reactive oxygen and lipid peroxidation levels in response to stress conditions (PubMed ID: 26436309).

ATCOX17 shares sequence similarity with COX17, another gene that is involved in the response to stress conditions (PubMed ID: 12177498). ATCOX17 encodes for a protein that is involved in the transfer of copper, which is a crucial nutrient for plant growth and development (PubMed ID: 26436309). ATCOX17 has been shown to affect the expression of genes involved in stress response, and its overexpression has been shown to increase the response to stress conditions (PubMed ID: 26436309).

COX17, another gene that is involved in the response to stress conditions, encodes for a chaperone that delivers copper to the enzyme (PubMed ID: 20700628). COX17 could have additional functions in the cell, and its overexpression has been shown to increase the response to stress conditions (PubMed ID: 20700628).

High concentrations of copper activate ATCOX17, and bacterial inoculation, salicylic acid treatment, and treatments that generate no and hydrogen peroxide also activate ATCOX17 (PubMed ID: 12177498). Proper distribution of copper requires COX17, and COX17-RNAI mutant reveals reduced level of COX17 mRNA (PubMed ID: 20700628).

In conclusion, the gene AT3G15352, also known as ATCOX17, plays a crucial role in the response of plants to stress conditions. Its overexpression has been shown to increase the response to stress conditions, and its ability to induce stress responses has been shown to cause a hyper-sensitive response-like necrotic response in tobacco leaves. Further research is needed to fully understand the function of ATCOX17 and its role in plant stress responses.

The specific mechanisms by which ATMBD11 regulates the expression of AT3G15790 are not yet fully understood, but it is likely that they involve the binding of ATMBD11 to specific DNA sequences or the regulation of transcription factors that interact with AT3G15790. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms of ATMBD11-mediated regulation of AT3G15790 expression and its role in plant development and disease resistance.

> Assistant:  The gene AT3G16240 encodes for the protein ATTIP2;1, which plays a crucial role in the transport of methylammonium/ammonium (NH4+) in plants. The protein localizes to the tonoplast, an organelle found in the chloroplasts of plant cells, and is influenced by nitrogen supply. Studies have shown that ATTIP2;1 does not alter ammonium accumulation in roots, but it is specifically needed in restricted cell populations, such as the placento-chalazal region and the outer integument. The protein also rescues triple tip mutants and facilitates permeation of water and ammonia. Additionally, ATTIP2;1 displays an extended selectivity filter, which allows it to selectively transport methylammonium/ammonium. The protein interacts with other proteins, such as TIP3;1 and PIP2;1, and is also expressed in vegetative tissues. The delta-tip protein, which is a homolog of ATTIP2;1, is found in the tonoplast and outer integument and responds to mercury. The NT AQP1 protein produces CO(2) permeability and affects CO(2) conductance, and RNA interference can repress its expression. The protein TIP2;1 and its homologs have no effect on subcellular localization after 45 minutes of salt exposure. The protein TIP1;2 interacts with TIP2;1, and transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpress ATTIP2;1. The proteins ATTIP1;1, ATTIP1;2, and ATTIP2;1 allow water influx, and sucrase starvation positively impacts delta-tip. Hybrid-type vacuoles lack delta-tip, and the protein is also found in the outer integument and placento-chalazal region.

However, PDR1 overexpression (OE) promotes plant biomass, lateral root formation, enhances phosphate uptake, accelerates root hair elongation, facilitates mycorrhization, represses leaf senescence, and allows increased endogenous Sl transport/biosynthesis (PubMed IDs: 29083039, 29083039, 29083039, 29083039, 29083039, 29083039).

ATABCG29, another gene involved in PDR1 regulation, delivers P-coumaryl alcohol (PubMed ID: 22704988). ATABCG29 localizes to root endodermis and vascular tissue (PubMed ID: 22704988). ATABCG29 enhances tolerance to P-coumaryl alcohol (PubMed ID: 22704988). ATABCG29 produces lignin subunits (PubMed ID: 22704988). ATABCG29 maintains secondary metabolite profiles (PubMed ID: 22704988). SVABCG17, a gene similar to ATABCG29, also regulates PDR1 expression (PubMed ID: 36525838).

Phytohormones, such as auxin and cytokinin, affect PDR1 expression (PubMed ID: 29083039). Soil phosphate abundance also affects PDR1 expression (PubMed ID: 29083039).

In summary, PDR1 is a crucial gene involved in various plant development and growth processes. Its expression is regulated by various factors, including phytohormones, nutrient availability, and soil phosphate abundance. PDR1 overexpression promotes plant biomass, lateral root formation, and increased endogenous Sl transport/biosynthesis.

TA-SIRNAs are produced in response to auxin signaling and are involved in the regulation of cell division, cell signaling, and root development. TAS3 also produces SIRNAs against ARF3, ARF4, and ARF2, which are involved in the regulation of cell division and cell signaling.

TAS3 is also involved in the regulation of leaf development and lateral organ separation. TA-SIRNAs produced by TAS3 regulate the formation of boundaries and the separation of lateral organs, and are involved in the regulation of leaf margin development. TAS3 also maintains N transport and root development, and increases association with translational machinery.

TAS3 models miRNA390, which is involved in the regulation of cell division and cell signaling. TAS3 represses ARF3/ARF4, and TASIR-ARF represses ARF3. TASIR-ARF is produced in the nucleolar epidermis and moves along the medial axis before entering hypodermal cells and moving basipetally into the chalaza.

TAS3 TA-SIRNA pathway regulates the formation of boundaries and the separation of lateral organs, and maintains leaf polarity. TAS3 genes show distinct pairing patterns in vascular plants, and are conserved in grass species. TAS3 SIRNAs display TASIR-ARFs and are related to non-TASIR-ARF group. Proper leaf development requires TAS3 TA-SIRNAs, and AGO7/ZIPPY acts through TAS3 TA-SIRNAs. DCL4 enhances TAS1 and TAS3 TA-SIRNA, and BIOGENESIS mechanism of TAS3 TA-SIRNA is conserved between monocots and dicots. MIR390 causes TAS3 in tomato, and TAS3 locus DNA methylation requires DCL1. ARGONAUTE7 represses TAS3, and SUPPRESSOR OF GENE SILENCING3 represses TAS3. TASIRNAs derive from TAS3 gene homologs, and TAS3 family reveals two members. SIRNA-target interactions are experimentally confirmed using TAS3 mutants, and phenotypic alterations are identified for mutants in three TAS3 loci. TAS3 SIRNA-target interactions occur extensively in rice polysoyme samples.

In summary, TAS3 is a key regulator of various cellular processes, including cell division, cell signaling, and root development. TAS3 produces TA-SIRNAs and SIRNAs that regulate gene expression by binding to specific target genes, and are involved in the regulation of leaf development and lateral organ separation. TAS3 is also involved in the regulation of cell division and cell signaling, and is conserved in grass species.
